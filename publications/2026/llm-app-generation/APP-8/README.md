# Simmer

Simmer is a recipe and cooking assistant designed to bring calm and focus to the kitchen. Its purpose is to eliminate the typical frustrations of online recipesâ€”like endless scrolling past blog posts, intrusive ads, and screens that turn off mid-recipe. Simmer provides a clean, distraction-free interface that guides you through cooking, one clear step at a time, so you can focus on the food, not the phone.

## Features

- **Distraction-Free Cooking Mode:** A beautiful, high-contrast view that displays only the current step in a large, easy-to-read font.
- **Hands-Free Navigation:** Move to the next or previous step with a simple wave of your hand over the device's proximity sensor.
- **Integrated Smart Timers:** Tap any time mentioned in a recipe step to start a large, full-screen timer.
- **Effortless Ingredient Scaling:** Instantly adjust the serving size with a simple slider.
- **One-Tap Shopping List:** Add all of a recipe's ingredients to a built-in shopping list, intelligently grouped by supermarket aisles.
- **Keep-Awake Screen:** The app automatically prevents your device's screen from dimming or locking while in Cooking Mode.
