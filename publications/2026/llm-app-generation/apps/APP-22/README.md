- `provider`: State management
- `riverpod`: Advanced state management
- `hive`: Local storage
- `shared_preferences`: Simple key-value storage

### UI & Navigation

## Configuration

### Audio Setup

The app uses `just_audio` for audio playback. For production use, you'll need to:

1. **Configure audio session** in `lib/shared/services/audio_service.dart`
2. **Set up proper audio URLs** in your data models
3. **Handle audio permissions** for different platforms

### API Integration

To connect with a real music API:

1. **Update base URL** in `lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart`
2. **Implement authentication** in `lib/features/auth/providers/auth_provider.dart`
3. **Replace mock data** with real API calls in providers

### Platform-Specific Setup

#### Android
- Add internet permission in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- Configure audio focus and media session

#### iOS
- Add audio background mode in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`
- Configure audio session category

## State Management

The app uses Provider pattern for state management:

- **AudioService**: Manages audio playback state
- **AuthProvider**: Handles user authentication
- **HomeProvider**: Manages home screen data
- **SearchProvider**: Handles search functionality
- **LibraryProvider**: Manages user library
- **PlayerProvider**: Controls player UI state

## Theming

The app features a dark theme inspired by Spotify's design:

- **Primary Color**: Spotify Green (#1DB954)
- **Background**: Dark (#191414)
- **Surface**: Dark Grey (#121212)
- **Typography**: Inter font family

Customize colors in `lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart`.

## Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
flutter test
```

For widget tests:
```bash
flutter test test/widget_test.dart
```

## Building for Production

### Android
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

### iOS
```bash
flutter build ios --release
```

## Performance Optimization

- **Image Caching**: Uses `cached_network_image` for efficient image loading
- **Lazy Loading**: Implements lazy loading for large lists
- **State Management**: Efficient state updates with Provider
- **Memory Management**: Proper disposal of controllers and streams
