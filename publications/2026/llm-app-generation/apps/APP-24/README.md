## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.1.0 or higher)
- Dart SDK (3.1.0 or higher)
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter extensions
- Android SDK (for Android development)
- Xcode (for iOS development, macOS only)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd waze_app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure API Keys**
   
   Update the following constants in `lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart`:
   ```dart
   static const String googleMapsApiKey = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY';
   static const String placesApiKey = 'YOUR_PLACES_API_KEY';
   ```

4. **Set up Google Maps**
   
   **For Android:**
   - Add your API key to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
              android:value="YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"/>
   ```

   **For iOS:**
   - Add your API key to `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`:
   ```swift
   GMSServices.provideAPIKey("YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY")
   ```

5. **Configure permissions**
   
   The app requires the following permissions:
   - Location (always and when in use)
   - Microphone (for voice commands)
   - Notifications
   - Phone (for emergency features)

6. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### API Keys Setup

#### Google Maps API Key

   - Maps SDK for Android
   - Maps SDK for iOS
   - Places API
   - Directions API
   - Geocoding API
4. Create credentials (API Key)
5. Restrict the API key to your app's package name

## Architecture

The app follows a clean architecture pattern with:
- **Presentation Layer**: Screens and widgets
- **Business Logic Layer**: Providers and state management (Riverpod)
- **Data Layer**: Models and services
- **External Layer**: APIs and device services

### State Management
- **Riverpod**: For reactive state management
- **StateNotifier**: For complex state logic
- **Provider**: For dependency injection

### Navigation
- **Go Router**: For declarative routing
- **Named routes**: For easy navigation management

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient map rendering with marker clustering
- Location updates optimized for battery life
- Image caching for map icons and user avatars
- Lazy loading for search results and route data

## Security

- API keys stored securely (not in version control)
- Location data handled according to privacy guidelines
- User data encrypted in local storage
- Network requests use HTTPS

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Map not loading**
   - Verify Google Maps API key is correct
   - Check API key restrictions
   - Ensure Maps SDK is enabled

2. **Location not working**
   - Check location permissions
   - Verify location services are enabled
   - Test on physical device (not simulator)

3. **Build errors**
   - Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
   - Check Flutter and Dart SDK versions
   - Verify all dependencies are compatible

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting:
```dart
const bool kDebugMode = true;
```
