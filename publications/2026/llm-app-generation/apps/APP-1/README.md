## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (3.8.1 or higher)
- Dart SDK (3.8.1 or higher)
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter extensions
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd audible_app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Generate code files**
   ```bash
   flutter pub run build_runner build
   ```

4. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   # For development (debug mode)
   flutter run
   
   # For web
   flutter run -d chrome
   
   # For specific device
   flutter run -d <device-id>
   ```

### Development Setup

1. **Code Generation**
   - Run `flutter pub run build_runner build` after modifying model files
   - Use `flutter pub run build_runner watch` for automatic generation during development

2. **State Management**
   - The app uses Riverpod for state management
   - Providers are organized by feature and functionality
   - Global state is managed in the core providers

3. **Theming**
   - Light and dark themes are defined in `lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart`
   - Custom colors and styles follow the Audible brand guidelines
   - Themes automatically switch based on system preferences

## Configuration

### App Constants
Key configuration values are defined in `lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart`:
- API endpoints and timeouts
- Storage keys for local data
- Playback settings and options
- UI constants and animations

### Dependencies
The app uses the following key dependencies:
- `flutter_riverpod`: State management
- `hive_flutter`: Local storage
- `just_audio`: Audio playback
- `go_router`: Navigation
- `cached_network_image`: Image caching
- `json_annotation`: JSON serialization

## Building for Production
