Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Survey": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Questions": {},
      "Frequency": {},
      "Deadline Date": {}
    }
  },
  "Self-Assessment": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Assessment questions": {},
      "Frequency": {},
      "Deadline Date": {}
    }
  },
  "Journal": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Journal prompts": {},
      "Frequency": {},
      "Deadline Date": {}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the introduction and conclusion sections, as well as the numberings and descriptions of the no-code elements. I only kept the names of the no-code elements and their corresponding parameters, and formatted them in JSON format.
