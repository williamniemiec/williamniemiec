Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Advocacy Offer": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Title": {"Type": "text"},
      "Message": {"Type": "text"},
      "Advocacy Options": {"Type": "options", "Options": ["navigating healthcare systems", "communicating with healthcare providers", "accessing resources"]},
      "Contact Information": {"Type": "contact information object"},
      "Accept/Decline": {"Type": "boolean"}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the "Not Applicable" parameters, which in this case were none. Let me know if you have any further questions!
