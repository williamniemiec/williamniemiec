Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Shoe Wear Guidance": {
        "parameters": [
            {"shoe_characteristics": "List of characteristics of recommended shoes"},
            {"shoe_types": "List of recommended shoe types"},
            {"avoid_shoe_types": "List of shoe types to avoid"},
            {"frequency": "Specify how often to wear recommended shoes"}
        ]
    }
}


I removed the not applicable parameter `"deadline_date"` since it's marked as `required: false`. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
