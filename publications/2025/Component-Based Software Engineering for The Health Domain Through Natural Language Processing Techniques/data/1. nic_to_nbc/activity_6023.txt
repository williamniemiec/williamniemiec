Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Role Transition Planner": {
    "parameters": {
      "Role Change Description": {},
      "Current Role": {},
      "New Role": {},
      "Task List": {},
      "Skill Assessment": {},
      "Goal Setting": {},
      "Support Network": {},
      "Progress Tracking": {}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the parameters that were marked as "Not Applicable" since there were none in this input.
