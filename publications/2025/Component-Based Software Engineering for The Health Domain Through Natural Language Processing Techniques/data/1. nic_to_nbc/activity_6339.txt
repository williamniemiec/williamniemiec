Here is the output in JSON format:



{
  "Clinic Access Assistance": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Clinic Selection": {"Type": "options"},
      "Appointment Scheduling": {"Type": "structured data"},
      "Transportation Assistance": {"Type": "text or structured data"},
      "Directions": {"Type": "text or structured data"}
    }
  }
}


I removed the "Additional Support" parameter as it was marked as not applicable. Let me know if you have any further questions!
