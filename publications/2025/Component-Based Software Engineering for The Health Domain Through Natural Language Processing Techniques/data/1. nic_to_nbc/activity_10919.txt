Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "question about self-care ability": {
        "name": "question about self-care ability",
        "answer type": "",
        "frequency": "",
        "deadline_date": ""
    },
    "task": {
        "name": "task title",
        "content": "",
        "frequency": "",
        "deadline_date": ""
    }
}


I removed all the unnecessary text and kept only the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and their corresponding `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed any "not applicable" parameters. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
