Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Moisturize": {
    "Area": {"type": "text", "default": "around nails"},
    "Frequency": {"type": "options", "options": ["daily", "everyOtherDay", "weekly", "monthly"]},
    "Deadline Date": {"type": "datetime"}
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Product` and `Notes` parameters as they are marked as optional. Let me know if you want to include them in the output as well!
