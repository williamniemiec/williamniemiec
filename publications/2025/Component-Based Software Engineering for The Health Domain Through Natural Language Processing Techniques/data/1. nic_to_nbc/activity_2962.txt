Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Verify Patient Statement": {
    "parameters": {
      "Patient Statement": {"type": "text"},
      "Verified Statement": {"type": "text"},
      "Verification Method": {"type": "options", "options": ["Repeating the statement back to the patient", "Asking the patient to confirm the statement", "Documenting the statement in the patient's record"]},
      "Frequency": {"type": "options", "options": ["During every interaction with the patient", "Only when necessary"]}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed `Deadline Date` parameter as it was not applicable (no specific value was provided).
