Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "name": {
    "type": "text"
  },
  "content": {
    "type": "text"
  },
  "myth_buster": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "myth": {
        "type": "text"
      },
      "fact": {
        "type": "text"
      }
    }
  },
  "reassurance": {
    "type": "text"
  },
  "image": {
    "type": "image URL or base64-encoded image"
  },
  "Education": {}
}


I removed the introduction, conclusion, and any unnecessary text, leaving only the parameter specifications and the no-code element name ("Education"). I also didn't include parameters that were marked as "not applicable". Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
