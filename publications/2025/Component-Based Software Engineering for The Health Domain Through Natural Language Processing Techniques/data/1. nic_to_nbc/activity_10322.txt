Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Resource Library": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Title": {"Type": "text"},
      "Resources": {"Type": "list of resources (e.g., PDF URLs, video URLs, online link URLs)"},
      "Resource type": {"Options": ["pamphlet", "video", "online link"]},
      "Description": {"Type": "text"}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Frequency` and `Deadline date` parameters as they are not applicable to the no-code element. Let me know if you have any further questions!
