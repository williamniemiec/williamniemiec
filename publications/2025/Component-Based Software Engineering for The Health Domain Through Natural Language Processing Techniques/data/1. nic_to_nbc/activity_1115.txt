Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "No-code Element Name": "Positioning Guide",
  "Parameters": {
    "Name": {"Type": "text"},
    "Extremity": {"Type": "options (list of extremities)"},
    "Positioning Instructions": {"Type": "illustrated guide (a combination of images and text)"},
    "Frequency": {"Type": "options (daily, every few hours, as needed)"}
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it's not applicable in this context.
