Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Sleep Enhancement": {
    "Current Sleep Hours": {},
    "Desired Sleep Hours": {},
    "Sleep Schedule": {},
    "Strategies to Improve Sleep": {},
    "Frequency": {}
  }
}


Note that I removed `Deadline Date` as it's not applicable in this context, and also removed the descriptions and other details, leaving only the parameter names. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
