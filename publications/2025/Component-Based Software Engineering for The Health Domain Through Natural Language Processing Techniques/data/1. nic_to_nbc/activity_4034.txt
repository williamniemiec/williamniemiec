Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Survey": {
    "Questions": ["How would you rate your pain level before and after heat/cold application?", "Did you experience any relief from symptoms after heat/cold application?", "Did you experience any side effects or discomfort during or after heat/cold application?"],
    "Frequency": ["daily", "everyHours", "everyDays"],
    "Deadline Date": "datetime"
  },
  "Journal": {
    "Entries": ["Date and time of heat/cold application", "Type of heat/cold application (e.g. warm compress, cold pack)", "Duration of heat/cold application", "Pain level or symptom severity before and after heat/cold application"],
    "Frequency": ["daily", "everyHours", "everyDays"]
  },
  "Report": {
    "Content": ["Summary of pain levels or symptom severity over time", "Effectiveness of heat/cold application in relieving symptoms", "Any side effects or discomfort experienced during or after heat/cold application"],
    "Frequency": ["daily", "weekly", "monthly"]
  }
}


I removed all the unnecessary text and only kept the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also formatted it in a JSON object with each no-code element as a key, and its parameters as values. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
