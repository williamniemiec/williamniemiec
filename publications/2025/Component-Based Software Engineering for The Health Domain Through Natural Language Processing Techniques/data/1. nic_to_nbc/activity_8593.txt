Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Dietary Instruction": {
    "parameters": [
      {"dietary_restriction": ""},
      {"rationale": ""},
      {"food_items": []},
      {"portion_control": ""},
      {"frequency": ""},
      {}
    ]
  }
}


Note: I removed the `deadline_date` parameter as it was not applicable. Also, I kept the `frequency` parameter even though it's an options type, but if you want to remove it as well, just let me know!
