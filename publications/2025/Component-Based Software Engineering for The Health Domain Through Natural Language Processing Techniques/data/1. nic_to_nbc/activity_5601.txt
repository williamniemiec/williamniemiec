Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Substance Abuse Prevention Guide": {
    "Name": {"type": "text"},
    "Description": {"type": "text"},
    "Risks of Substance Abuse": {"type": "list", "items": ["list of risks, with descriptions and statistics"]},
    "Alternatives to Substance Abuse": {"type": "list", "items": ["list of alternatives, with descriptions and resources"]},
    "Goal Setting": {"type": "boolean"}
  }
}


Note that I removed the unnecessary parameters and reformatted the output in a more readable JSON format. Let me know if you have any further requests!
