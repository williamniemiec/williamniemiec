Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Fluid Imbalance Risk Factors": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {"Type": "text"},
      "Risk Factors": {"Type": "form", "Fields": [...]},
      "Risk Factor Severity": {"Type": "options", "Options": [...]},
      "Deadline Date": {"Type": "datetime"},
      "Notes": {"Type": "text"}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Fields` array contents to simplify the output, as it was a long list of objects. If you need the full contents, let me know!
