Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Oxygen Sensor Monitoring": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Sensor Type": {
        "Options": ["finger", "nose", "forehead"]
      },
      "Patient Risk Factors": {
        "Type": "options"
      },
      "Alarm Thresholds": {
        "Type": "number"
      },
      "Alarm Settings": {
        "Type": "options"
      },
      "Agency Policy": {
        "Type": "text"
      }
    }
  }
}


I removed the parameters that were not applicable (Device Settings) and formatted the remaining information according to your request.
