Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Personal Clothing": {
        "Clothing Prompt": {
            "Description": "Provide a prompt or question to encourage the patient to dress in personal clothing",
            "Required": true,
            "Type": "text"
        },
        "Frequency": {
            "Description": "Specify how often the patient should be reminded to dress in personal clothing",
            "Required": true,
            "Type": "options",
            "Options": [
                { "value": "daily", "label": "Daily" },
                { "value": "onlyOnce", "label": "Only once" },
                { "value": "everyHours", "label": "Every x hours" },
                { "value": "everyDays", "label": "Every x days" }
            ]
        }
    }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` and `Personal Clothing Options` parameters because they are not required. Let me know if you want to include them as well!
