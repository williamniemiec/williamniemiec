Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Instruction": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Title": {},
      "Video": {}
    }
  }
}


I removed all unnecessary information and kept only the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` which is `"Instruction"` and the required `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the not applicable parameters (Reminder and Confirmation) since they are optional. Let me know if this meets your requirements!
