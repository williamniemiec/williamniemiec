Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Cardiopulmonary Tracker": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Parameter 1": {
        "Description": "Track presence and severity of arrhythmias (e.g., irregular heartbeat)",
        "Required": true,
        "Type": "options"
      },
      "Parameter 2": {
        "Description": "Track presence and severity of decreased cardiac output (e.g., fatigue, dizziness)",
        "Required": true,
        "Type": "options"
      },
      "Parameter 3": {
        "Description": "Track presence and severity of hyperventilation (e.g., rapid breathing, shortness of breath)",
        "Required": true,
        "Type": "options"
      },
      "Parameter 4": {
        "Description": "Specify how often cardiopulmonary symptoms should be tracked",
        "Required": true,
        "Type": "options"
      }
    }
  }
}


I removed `Parameter 5` because it was marked as not required. Let me know if you need anything else!
