Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Emotion Tracker": {
    "parameters": {
      "Emotion Type": {
        "type": "options"
      },
      "Intensity Level": {
        "type": "options"
      },
      "Frequency": {
        "type": "options"
      }
    }
  }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters (`Deadline Date` and `Resources`) as they don't seem to be relevant to the no-code element. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
