Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Caregiver Guide": {
    "Guidelines": {"type": "list of text"},
    "Warning Signs": {"type": "list of text"},
    "Crisis Intervention": {"type": "text"},
    "Resources": {"type": "list of multimedia resources"}
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Quiz` parameter as it was marked as "not applicable" (i.e., it's a multiple-choice question, which is not typically used in this context). Let me know if you have any further questions!
