Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Cue Management": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Cue Type": ["verbal", "physical"],
      "Initial Cue Level": "slider (e.g., 0-100%) or numerical value",
      "Target Cue Level": "slider (e.g., 0-100%) or numerical value",
      "Decrease Frequency": ["daily", "everyOtherDay", "weekly", "biweekly"]
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Notes` parameter as it's not applicable in this context, and also removed other unnecessary information to produce a clean JSON output. Let me know if you have any further questions!
