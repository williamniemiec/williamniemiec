Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Reassuring Tone": {
    "audio title": {},
    "reassuring tone audio": {},
    "frequency of reassuring tone audio": {}
  }
}


I removed all the unnecessary information and kept only the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it was marked as not required. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
