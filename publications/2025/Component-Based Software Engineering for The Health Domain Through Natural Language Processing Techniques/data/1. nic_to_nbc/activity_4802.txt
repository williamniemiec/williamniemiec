Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Spatial Organization Activity": {
    "Puzzle Type": {
      "Type": "options",
      "Options": ["shape sorting", "block stacking", "object arrangement"]
    },
    "Puzzle Difficulty": {
      "Type": "options",
      "Options": ["easy", "medium", "hard"]
    },
    "Puzzle Pieces": {
      "Type": "list",
      "List": ["5 shapes", "10 blocks", "3 objects"]
    },
    "Goal": {
      "Type": "text"
    },
    "Frequency": {
      "Type": "options",
      "Options": ["daily", "every other day", "weekly"]
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it's not applicable since its type is `datetime`, which doesn't fit with the other parameters. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
