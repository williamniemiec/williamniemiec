Since there is no specific `PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS` section in the input text, I will assume it is not applicable.

As for the `NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME`, I can extract the following information:

{}
"no-code element name": ["educates patients on the potential causes of increasing serum potassium levels", "provides general information on how to manage conditions that may affect potassium levels"]
