Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Pressure Avoidance Instruction": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": {"type": "text"},
      "content": {"type": "text or video"},
      "images": {"type": "list of images"},
      "affected_body_part": {"type": "options (list of body parts)"},
      "avoidance_tips": {"type": "list of text"},
      "frequency": {"type": "options (e.g., always, during certain activities, as needed)"}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `deadline_date` parameter since it's not applicable in this context. Let me know if you have any further questions!
