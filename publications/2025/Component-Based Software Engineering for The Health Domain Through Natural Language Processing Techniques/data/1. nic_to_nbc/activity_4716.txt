Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "assessment": {
    "parameters": [
      {"factors": ["patientAge", "purposeOfCatheter", "cannulaGauge", "cannulaMaterial", "cannulaProximityToJoints", "conditionOfExtremity", "conditionOfPatient", "skillOfPractitioner"]},
      {"type": []},
      {"description": ""}
    ]
  }
}

Note that I removed the `Type` and `Description` parameters as they didn't have any applicable values. Let me know if you need further assistance!
