Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Administration Guide": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Content": {"Type": "text or html"},
      "Methods": {"Type": "list of methods"},
      "Descriptions": {"Type": "list of descriptions"},
      "Resources": {"Type": "list of resources"},
      "Frequency": {"Type": "options"}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it was marked as a datetime type, which is not applicable in this context.
