Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "oral_assessment": {
        "parameters": [
            {"name": "assessment_type", "description": "type of oral assessment"},
            {"name": "assessment_frequency", "description": "how often the oral assessment should be performed"},
            {"name": "notes", "description": "additional notes or comments about the oral assessment"}
        ]
    }
}


Note: I removed the `required` and `type` fields, as well as the `options` array for the `assessment_type` and `assessment_frequency` parameters, as per your request. Let me know if you need anything else!
