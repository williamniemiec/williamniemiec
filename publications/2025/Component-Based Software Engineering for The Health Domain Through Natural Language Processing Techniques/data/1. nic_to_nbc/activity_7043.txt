Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Abdominal Girth Tracker": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "",
      "unit": "",
      "frequency": "",
      "notes": ""
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed `deadline_date` as it's not applicable to the no-code element, and also removed any descriptive text, keeping only the essential information.
