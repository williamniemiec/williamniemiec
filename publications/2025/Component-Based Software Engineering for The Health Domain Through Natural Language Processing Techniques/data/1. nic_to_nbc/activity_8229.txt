Here is the output in JSON format:

{
    "name": "bandage",
    "parameters": [
        { 
            "name": "duration", 
            "description": "specify the duration to keep the bandage on", 
            "required": true, 
            "type": "range",
            "range": {
                "min": 2,
                "max": 6,
                "unit": "hours"
            }
        }
    ]
}

I removed the "instructions" parameter as it was marked as not required. Let me know if you need anything else!
