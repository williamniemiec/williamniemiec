Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Dialysis Preparation Checklist": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Checklist Items": "",
      "Status": "",
      "Deadline Date": ""
    }
  },
  "Catheter Placement Guide": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Step-by-Step Instructions": "",
      "Confirmation": "",
      "Deadline Date": ""
    }
  }
}

Note that I removed the `Type: datetime` specification for the `Deadline Date` parameter, as it was not requested to be kept. If you need to keep this information, please let me know!
