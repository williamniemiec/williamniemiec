Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "UTI Education": {
    "Content": {"Description": "Educational content about signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection", "Required": true, "Type": "text"},
    "Quiz": {"Description": "Quiz to test patient's understanding of UTI signs and symptoms", "Required": false, "Type": "quiz"}
  }
}


Note: I removed the "Resources" parameter since it is marked as not required. If you want to include non-required parameters as well, let me know!
