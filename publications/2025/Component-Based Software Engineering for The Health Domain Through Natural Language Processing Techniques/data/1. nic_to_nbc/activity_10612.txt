Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Sensory Discrimination": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Instructions": {},
      "Frequency": {},
      "Sensations to Test": {},
      "Reporting": {}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the "Reminders" parameter since it's type is boolean and considered not applicable according to your instructions.
