Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Emotional Expression": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Emotion": ["Grief", "Anger"],
      "Alteration type": ["Body functioning", "Body appearance"],
      "Expression method": ["Verbal expression", "Written expression", "Artistic expression"],
      "Support system": ["Family support", "Friend support", "Mental health professional"],
      "Frequency": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"]
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it had a specific type (`datetime`) and no applicable values were provided.
