Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Nutritional Supplement Task": {
    "parameters": [
      {"Name": "text"},
      {"Supplement Type": "options"},
      {"Dosage": "numeric"},
      {"Frequency": "numeric"},
      {"Duration": "numeric"},
      {"Instructions": "text"}
    ]
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Monitoring` parameter as it was marked as not applicable (`required`: `false`). Let me know if you have any further questions!
