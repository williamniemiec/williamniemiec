Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Care Team": {
    "Team Members": {
      "type": "list of team members (each with name, role, and contact info)"
    },
    "Communication Preferences": {
      "type": "list of communication preferences"
    }
  },
  "Appointment Manager": {
    "Appointment Schedule": {
      "type": "list of appointments (each with date, time, location, and provider)"
    },
    "Reminders": {
      "type": "list of reminders (each with date, time, and message)"
    }
  },
  "Secure Messaging": {
    "Message Thread": {
      "type": "list of messages (each with sender, recipient, date, and content)"
    },
    "Message Composition": {
      "type": "message composition (with recipient, subject, and content)"
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the introduction, numberings, and conclusion from the original text, and only kept the no-code element names and their corresponding parameter specifications. I also reformatted the output in JSON format as requested.
