Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Device Guide": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Device Name": {"Type": "text", "Required": true},
      "Assembly Instructions": {"Type": "ordered list of text and images", "Required": true},
      "Usage Instructions": {"Type": "ordered list of text and images", "Required": true},
      "Maintenance Instructions": {"Type": "ordered list of text and images", "Required": true},
      "Frequency": {"Type": "options", "Required": true}
    }
  }
}


I removed the non-applicable parameters (Videos and Deadline Date) since they are not required. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
