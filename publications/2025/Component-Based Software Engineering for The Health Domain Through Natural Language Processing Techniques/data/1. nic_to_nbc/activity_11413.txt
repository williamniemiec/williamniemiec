Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Post-Massage Instructions": {
    "Rest Instruction": {"type": "text"},
    "Movement Instruction": {"type": "text"},
    "Duration": {"type": "options"},
    "Frequency": {"type": "options"}
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it was marked as "datetime" which is not applicable in this context.
