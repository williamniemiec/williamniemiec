Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Relocation Discussion": {
    "parameters": {
      "Relocation Reason": {"type": "categorical"},
      "Relocation Options": {"type": "list"},
      "Patient/Family Concerns": {"type": "text"},
      "Healthcare Provider Recommendations": {"type": "text"},
      "Decision": {"type": "categorical"},
      "Additional Notes": {"type": "text"}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Date and Time` parameter as it is not applicable (it's automatically recorded, so it doesn't need to be specified). Let me know if you have any further questions!
