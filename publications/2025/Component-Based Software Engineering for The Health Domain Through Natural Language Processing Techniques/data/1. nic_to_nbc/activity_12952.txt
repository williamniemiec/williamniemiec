Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "name": "Decision Tree",
    "parameters": [
        {
            "name": "Scenario",
            "type": "text"
        },
        {
            "name": "Options",
            "type": "list of options"
        },
        {
            "name": "Consequences",
            "type": "list of consequences"
        },
        {
            "name": "Frequency",
            "type": "options"
        }
    ]
}

Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it was not applicable in this case. Also, I simplified the JSON structure to only include the necessary information.
