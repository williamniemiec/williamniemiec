Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Interdisciplinary Collaboration": {
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "name", "description": "title or name of the interdisciplinary collaboration"},
      {"name": "healthcare providers", "description": "a list of healthcare providers involved in the collaboration"},
      {"name": "options", "description": "a list of options to be discussed (e.g., whole truth, partial truth, decision delay)"},
      {"name": "participation roles", "description": "specifies the role of each healthcare provider in the chosen option"},
      {"name": "meeting schedule", "description": "specifies the schedule for the collaboration meeting"}
    ]
  }
}


I removed the `deadline_date` parameter since it's not applicable (optional). Let me know if you need any further assistance!
