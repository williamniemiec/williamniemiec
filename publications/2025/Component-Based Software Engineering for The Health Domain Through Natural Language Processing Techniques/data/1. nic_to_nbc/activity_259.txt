Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Clinical Specialist Directory": {
    "Specialist List": {
      "Description": "List of clinical specialists available for consultation",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "list-item",
      "List-item": "list of specialist objects, each with a name, title, and specialty"
    },
    "Consultation Request": {
      "Description": "Form to request a consultation with a clinical specialist",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "form",
      "Form": "list of form field objects, each with a label, type, and value"
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Filter Options` parameter since it's not required. Let me know if you need anything else!
