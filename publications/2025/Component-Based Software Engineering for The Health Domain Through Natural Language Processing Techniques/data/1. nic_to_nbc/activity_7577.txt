Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Interaction Preparation": {
    "parameters": [
      {"Name": "A parameter that specifies the title or name of the guidance."},
      {"Eye Contact Guidance": "A parameter that provides guidance on how to use eye contact during interaction."},
      {"Touch Guidance": "A parameter that provides guidance on how to use touch during interaction."},
      {"Tips": "A parameter that provides additional tips or recommendations for preparing for interaction."},
      {"Frequency": "A parameter that specifies how often the patient or caregiver should review the guidance."},
      // Removed Deadline Date as it's not applicable
    ]
  }
}


Note: I removed `Deadline Date` from the output as it's not applicable, and also reformatted the JSON to make it more readable. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
