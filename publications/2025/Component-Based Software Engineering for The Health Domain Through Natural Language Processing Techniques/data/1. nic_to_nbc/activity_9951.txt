        "Are you currently experiencing financial difficulties or poverty?",

I removed all the unnecessary text and only kept the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}` parts. I also removed the "not applicable" parameters. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
