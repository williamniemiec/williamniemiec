Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Object Stacking": {
    "parameters": [
      {"Name": "text"},
      {"Instructions": "text"},
      {"Object List": "unordered list"},
      {"Stacking Method": "options"},
      {"Tips": "text"},
      {"Frequency": "options"}
    ]
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it was marked as not required, and also removed other irrelevant information from the original text. Let me know if this meets your requirements!
