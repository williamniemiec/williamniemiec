Here is the output in JSON format:

{
  "Infant Alertness": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Alertness Techniques": {
        "Description": "Techniques to increase infant alertness",
        "Required": true,
        "Type": "options",
        "Options": [
          { "value": "loosenClothes", "label": "Loosen infant's clothes" },
          { "value": "rubHandsFeet", "label": "Rub hands and feet" },
          { "value": "talkToInfant", "label": "Talk to infant" }
        ]
      },
      "Instructions": {
        "Description": "Step-by-step instructions for each alertness technique",
        "Required": true,
        "Type": "text"
      }
    }
  }
}

I removed the non-applicable parameters (`Tips` and `Video`) as they were not required. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
