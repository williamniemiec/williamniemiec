Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Immunization Status Checker": {
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "Immunization History", "type": "list of immunization records"},
      {"name": "Current Visit Information", "type": "visit object"},
      {"name": "Immunization Schedule", "type": "list of immunization schedules"},
      {"name": "Immunization Recommendations", "type": "list of immunization recommendations"}
    ]
  },
  "Question": {
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "Question", "type": "text"},
      {"name": "Answer Type", "type": "options"},
      {"name": "Immunization Recommendations", "type": "list of immunization recommendations"},
      {"name": "Follow-up Questions", "type": "list of questions"}
    ]
  }
}

Note that I removed the not applicable parameters and only kept the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}` parts as per your request. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
