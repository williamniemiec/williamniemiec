Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Equipment Cleaning": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {},
      "Equipment": {},
      "Cleaning Instructions": {},
      "Status": {},
      "Frequency": {}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it's not applicable (datetime type is not typically used in no-code elements). Let me know if this meets your requirements!
