Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Reference Range Guide": {
        "Tests": {
            "Test Name": "",
            "Reference Range": ""
        },
        "Laboratory": "",
        "Frequency": ""
    }
}


Note that I removed the `Description` and other unnecessary parameters, as well as the `INTRODUCTION` and `CONCLUSION` sections. I also removed the `Content Type` parameter since it's not a part of the `PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS`. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
