Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Nutrition Guidance": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Nutrition Guidance Title": {},
      "Nutritional Requirements Instructions": {},
      "Dietary Modifications Instructions": {},
      "Dietician Collaboration Information": {},
      "Frequency": {},
      "Meal Planning Resources": {}
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it was marked as not required. Let me know if this meets your requirements!
