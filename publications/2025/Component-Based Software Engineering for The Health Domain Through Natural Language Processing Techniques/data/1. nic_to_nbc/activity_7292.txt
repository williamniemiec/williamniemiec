Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Measurement": {
        "title": "",
        "measurement_type": ["Length", "Width", "Depth", "Area"],
        "unit": "",
        "frequency": "",
        "deadline": "",
        "instructions": ""
    },
    "Task": {
        "title": "",
        "instructions": "",
        "frequency": "",
        "deadline": "",
        "condition": ""
    }
}


Note that I removed the introduction and conclusion sections, as well as the element descriptions. I also removed the "not applicable" parameters, which were not specified in the input text. The resulting JSON object contains only the no-code element names and their corresponding parameter specifications.
