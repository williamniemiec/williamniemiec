Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Family Relationship Assessment": {
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "Family Members", "type": "list of text"},
      {"name": "Relationship Types", "type": "options"},
      {"name": "Relationship Strength", "type": "options"},
      {"name": "Open-Ended Question", "type": "text"},
      {"name": "Frequency", "type": "options"}
    ]
  }
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it was not applicable. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
