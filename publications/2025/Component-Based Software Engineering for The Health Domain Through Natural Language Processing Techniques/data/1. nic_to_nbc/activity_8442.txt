Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Medication Alert": {
    "parameters": [
      {
        "name": "medications_to_avoid",
        "description": "List of medications to avoid"
      },
      {
        "name": "reason",
        "description": "Reason for avoiding medications"
      },
      {
        "name": "frequency",
        "description": "How often to remind patient and/or family to avoid medications"
      }
    ]
  }
}


Note: I removed the `deadline_date` parameter as it was marked as not required (`"required": false`). Let me know if you need any further modifications!
