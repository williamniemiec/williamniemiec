Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Privacy Policy": {
        "type": "text"
    },
    "Confidentiality Statement": {
        "type": "text"
    },
    "Agreement": {
        "type": "boolean (true/false)"
    },
    "Signature": {
        "type": "electronic signature"
    },
    "Date": {
        "type": "datetime"
    },
    "Encryption": {
        "type": "text"
    },
    "Access Control": {
        "type": "text"
    },
    "Audit Trail": {
        "type": "text"
    }
}


I removed the introduction, conclusion, and no-code element name ("Privacy and Confidentiality Agreement") from the input text. I also kept only the parameter specifications that were applicable (i.e., had a type specified). The resulting JSON object contains the parameter names as keys and their corresponding types as values.
