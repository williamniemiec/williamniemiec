Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Fluid Administration": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Fluid Type": {},
      "Fluid Name": {},
      "Dosage": {},
      "Frequency": {}
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Physician Collaboration` parameter as it's a boolean value and not applicable in this context. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
