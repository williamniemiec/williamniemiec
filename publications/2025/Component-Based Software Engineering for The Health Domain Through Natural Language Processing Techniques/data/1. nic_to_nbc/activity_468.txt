Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Equipment Check": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Equipment Type": {},
      "Equipment Status": {},
      "Checklist Items": {},
      "Additional Notes": {}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed `Date and Time` from the parameters as it's not a configurable parameter, but rather an automatically recorded value.
