Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Family Engagement": {
    "parameters": {
      "Child's Schedule": {"type": "datetime", "required": true},
      "Family Member Roles": {"type": "options", "required": true},
      "Communication Platform": {"type": "text/html", "required": true},
      "Goal Setting": {"type": "text", "required": true},
      "Progress Tracking": {"type": "datetime", "required": true}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the "Resources" parameter since it was marked as not required (`"Required": false`). Let me know if you need anything else!
