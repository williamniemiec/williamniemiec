Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Hemodynamic Monitor": {
    "parameters": {
      "Blood Pressure": {"type": ["number", "text"]},
      "Heart Rate": {"type": ["number", "text"]},
      "Oxygen Saturation": {"type": ["number", "text"]},
      "Symptoms": {"type": ["text", "options"]},
      "Frequency": {"type": ["options"]}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the "options" details for "Symptoms" and "Frequency" as they were not applicable parameters. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
