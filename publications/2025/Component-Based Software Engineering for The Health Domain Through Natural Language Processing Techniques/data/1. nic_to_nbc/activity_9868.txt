Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Family Normalization Plan": {
    "Normalization Strategies": {"type": "options", "options": ["establish routines", "set boundaries", "promote open communication"]},
    "Family Member Input": {"type": "text or form"},
    "Goal Setting": {"type": "text or form"}
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Action Plan` parameter as it was not applicable due to the excessive number of exclamation marks, which made it unclear what the actual value or type should be.
