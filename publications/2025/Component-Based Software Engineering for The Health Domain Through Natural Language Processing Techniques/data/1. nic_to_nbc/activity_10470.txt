Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Epinephrine Pen Tutorial": {
    "Parameters": [
      {"Title": {"Description": "Title of the tutorial", "Required": true, "Type": "text"}},
      {"Simulation Steps": {"Description": "List of interactive steps to demonstrate the use of an epinephrine pen", "Required": true, "Type": "interactive simulation steps", "Interactive simulation steps": "List of HTML texts, images, and interactive elements (e.g., drag-and-drop, click-and-reveal)"}},
      {"Instructions": {"Description": "List of written instructions on how to use an epinephrine pen", "Required": true, "Type": "unordered list", "Unordered list": "List of text items"}}
    ]
  }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters (`Video Demonstration` and `Quiz`) since they are marked as `false` in the `Required` field. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
