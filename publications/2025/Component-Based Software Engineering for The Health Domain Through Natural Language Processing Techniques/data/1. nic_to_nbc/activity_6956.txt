Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Neck Support Guide": {
        "Parameters": {
            "Name": {},
            "Support Method": {},
            "Instructions": {},
            "Frequency": {}
        }
    }
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it's not applicable, and only kept the necessary information: the no-code element name and its parameters.
