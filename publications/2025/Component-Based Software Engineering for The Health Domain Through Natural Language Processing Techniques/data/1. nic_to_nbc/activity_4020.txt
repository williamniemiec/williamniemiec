Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Safe Play": {
    "Age Range": {
      "type": "options",
      "options": [
        "0-3 months",
        "4-6 months",
        "7-9 months",
        "10-12 months"
      ]
    },
    "Developmental Stage": {
      "type": "options",
      "options": [
        "Cognitive",
        "Motor",
        "Language",
        "Social-Emotional"
      ]
    },
    "Toy and Activity Recommendations": {
      "type": "list",
      "examples": [
        "For a 4-6 month old infant in the cognitive developmental stage, recommend toys that promote problem-solving and exploration, such as shape sorters and stacking toys.",
        "For a 7-9 month old infant in the motor developmental stage, recommend activities that promote gross motor skills, such as crawling tunnels and playmats."
      ]
    },
    "Safety Guidelines": {
      "type": null
    }
  }
}

I removed all unnecessary information and kept only the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` ("Safe Play") and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the "Not Applicable" parameters (in this case, none).
