Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Emotional Awareness Statement": {
    "Statement": ["I can see that you're feeling upset.", "It sounds like you're really struggling with this.", "I'm here to support you and acknowledge your emotions."],
    "Tone": ["Empathetic", "Compassionate", "Non-judgmental"],
    "Frequency": ["daily", "weekly", "monthly"]
  },
  "Emotional Check-In": {
    "Question": ["How are you feeling today?", "What emotions are you experiencing right now?", "Can you rate your emotional state on a scale of 1-10?"],
    "Response Type": ["Text", "Audio", "Video"],
    "Frequency": ["daily", "weekly", "monthly"]
  }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters (`Deadline Date` and `Content Type`) and formatted the remaining information into a JSON object with each no-code element as a key, containing its respective parameters as values.
