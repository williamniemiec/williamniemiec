Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Reproductive Education": {
    "Topic": {"Type": "options", "Required": true},
    "Content": {"Type": "multimedia content", "Required": true},
    "Frequency": {"Type": "options", "Required": true}
  }
}


I removed the parameters that were not applicable (i.e., had a `Required` value of `false`) and only kept the `Name` and `Parameters` sections, as per your request. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
