Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Consent Form": {
        "name": "",
        "form_content": "",
        "consent_options": "",
        "frequency": ""
    },
    "Patient Information Form": {
        "name": "",
        "form_content": "",
        "information_categories": "",
        "frequency": ""
    },
    "Emergency Services Notification": {
        "name": "",
        "notification_content": "",
        "notification_method": "",
        "frequency": ""
    },
    "Technology Inventory": {
        "name": "",
        "inventory_content": "",
        "technology_categories": "",
        "frequency": ""
    }
}


Note that I removed the "deadline_date" parameter from each element as it was not applicable. Also, I did not include any values for the parameters as they were not provided in the input text.
