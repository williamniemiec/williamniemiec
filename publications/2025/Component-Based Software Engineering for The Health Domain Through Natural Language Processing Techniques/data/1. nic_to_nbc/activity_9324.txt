Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "name": "discussion",
    "parameters": [
        { 
            "name": "unacceptable_behavior", 
        },
        { 
            "name": "reasons", 
        },
        { 
            "name": "questions", 
        },
        { 
            "name": "reflection", 
        },
        { 
            "name": "frequency", 
        }
    ]
}


I removed the `description` and other fields that were not requested, as well as the `deadline_date` parameter since it was marked as not required. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
