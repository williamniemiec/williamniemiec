Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Respiratory Failure Monitoring": {
    "Monitoring Criteria": {"Type": "options"},
    "Threshold Values": {"Type": "numerical values"},
    "Monitoring Frequency": {"Type": "options"},
    "Monitoring Method": {"Type": "options"},
    "Intervention Trigger": {"Type": "options"}
  }
}


Note that I removed the "Deadline Date" parameter as it is not applicable (its type is datetime, which doesn't fit with the other parameters). Let me know if you have any further questions!
