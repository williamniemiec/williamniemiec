Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Oral Comfort Measure": {
    "Name": {"type": "text"},
    "Option": {"type": "options", "options": ["Ice Chips", "Wet Washcloth", "Hard Candy"]},
    "Frequency": {"type": "options", "options": ["As needed", "Daily", "Every x hours", "Every x days"]},
    "Instructions": {"type": "text"}
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it's not applicable in this context, and also removed the description and content type fields as they are not part of the `PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS`. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
