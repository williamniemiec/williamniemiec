Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Self-Induction Guide": {
        "Parameters": {
            "Instructions": {"Type": "text"},
            "Tips": {"Type": "text"},
            "Frequency": {"Type": "options"},
            "Tracking": {"Type": "boolean"}
        }
    }
}


Note: I removed the "Reminders" parameter as it is not applicable (i.e., it has no effect on the functionality of the no-code element). Let me know if you need any further assistance!
