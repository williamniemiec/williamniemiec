Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Milk Supply Optimization Guide": {
    "Guide Title": {},
    "Strategies": {},
    "Instructions": {},
    "Frequency": {}
  }
}


I removed all unnecessary information and only kept the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and the `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the not applicable parameters (`Videos` and `Deadline Date`) since they are not required. Let me know if this is what you were expecting!
