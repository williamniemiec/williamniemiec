Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Holistic Care Reminder": {
    "reflection title": {
      "Description": "title of the holistic care reminder reflection",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "text"
    },
    "holistic care reminder reflection": {
      "Description": "text encouraging the patient to focus on their overall well-being rather than just the task at hand",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "text"
    },
    "Frequency": {
      "Description": "specify how often the patient should be reminded to focus on their overall well-being",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "options",
      "Options": [
        { "value": "daily", "label": "Daily" },
        { "value": "onlyOnce", "label": "Only once" },
        { "value": "everyHours", "label": "Every x hours" },
        { "value": "everyDays", "label": "Every x days" }
      ]
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Image` and `Deadline Date` parameters as they are not required. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
