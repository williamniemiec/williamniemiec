Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Injection Site Pressure Guidance": {
    "Pressure Type": {},
    "Massage Avoidance": {},
    "Pressure Duration": {},
    "Visual Aid": {},
    "Frequency": {}
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it was marked as "Not Applicable" in the input text.
