Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Learning Module": {
    "Name": {"type": "text"},
    "Content": {"type": "rich text or multimedia"},
    "Objectives": {"type": "text"},
    "Time Allocation": {"type": "time duration"},
    "Frequency": {"type": "options"}
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it was marked as `datetime` which is not applicable in this context.
