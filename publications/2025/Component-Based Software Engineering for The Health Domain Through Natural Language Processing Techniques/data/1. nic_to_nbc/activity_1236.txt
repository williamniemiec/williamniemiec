Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Flexible Learning": {
    "Learning content": {"type": "text"},
    "Adaptive difficulty": {"options": ["yes", "no"]},
    "Pacing control": {"options": ["patient-controlled", "system-controlled"]},
    "Feedback": {"options": ["yes", "no"]}
  }
}


Note that I removed the "Deadline" parameter since it has an option "no deadline" which is considered as not applicable. Let me know if this meets your requirements!
