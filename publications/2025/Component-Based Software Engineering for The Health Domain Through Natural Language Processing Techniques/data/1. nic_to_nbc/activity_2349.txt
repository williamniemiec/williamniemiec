Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Emergency Contact List": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "",
      "contacts": [],
      "contact_info": [],
      "notes": "",
      "frequency": ""
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed `deadline_date` as it was marked as optional, and I assumed it's not applicable in this case. Let me know if you want to include it anyway!
