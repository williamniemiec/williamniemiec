Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Assertive Behavior Strategies": {
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "making_requests"},
      {"name": "saying_no"},
      {"name": "initiating_conversation"},
      {"name": "concluding_conversation"},
      {"name": "examples"},
      {"name": "frequency"},
      {"name": "deadline_date"}
    ]
  }
}


Note that I removed the `description` field and only kept the `parameters` section with the `name` field for each parameter. I also removed the `required`, `type`, and other fields as they were not specified in the original request. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
