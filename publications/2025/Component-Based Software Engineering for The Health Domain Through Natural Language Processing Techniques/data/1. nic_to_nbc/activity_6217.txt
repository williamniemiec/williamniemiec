Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Calm and Reassuring Message": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Message": {},
      "Tone": {},
      "Frequency": {}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed `Deadline Date` as it's not applicable to the no-code element, and only kept the essential parameters that are relevant to the element.
