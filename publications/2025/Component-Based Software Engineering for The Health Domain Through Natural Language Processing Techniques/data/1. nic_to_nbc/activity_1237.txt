Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Ointment Application Instruction": {
    "Ointment Application Title": {},
    "Ointment Type": {},
    "Application Instructions": {},
    "Frequency": {}
  }
}


I removed all non-applicable parameters (those with `Required: false`) and only kept the `Name` of the no-code element and its `Parameters`.
