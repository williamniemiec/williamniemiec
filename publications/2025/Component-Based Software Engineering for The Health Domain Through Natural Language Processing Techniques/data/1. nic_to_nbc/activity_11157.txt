Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Tutorial": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "Suture Line Security",
      "content": "Secure the suture line with square knots",
      "type": "interactive tutorial",
      "steps": [
        "Step 1: Hold the suture thread in one hand",
        "Step 2: Create a loop with the thread",
        "Step 3: Pass the thread through the loop",
        "Step 4: Pull the thread tight to create a square knot"
      ],
      "images": "a series of images or illustrations to help demonstrate each step",
      "interactive elements": "(optional) interactive elements, such as a virtual suture thread, to help patients practice and learn"
    }
  }
}


I removed all unnecessary text and only kept the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` (which is "Tutorial") and the `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the "videos" parameter since it was marked as optional. Let me know if you have any further questions!
