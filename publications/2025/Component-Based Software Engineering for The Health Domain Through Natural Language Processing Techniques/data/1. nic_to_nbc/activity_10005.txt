Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Playground Activity": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {},
      "Description": {},
      "Frequency": {},
      "Duration": {}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it's not applicable, and also removed any text that was not part of the `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}` or `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}`. Let me know if this is what you were expecting!
