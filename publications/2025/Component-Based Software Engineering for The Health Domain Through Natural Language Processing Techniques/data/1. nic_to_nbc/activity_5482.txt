Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Device Recommendation": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Device Type": {},
      "Reason": {},
      "Instructions": {},
      "Image/Video": {},
      "Frequency": {}
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it's not applicable, and also removed the introduction, number, no-code element description, and conclusion parts as per your request. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
