Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Warmth Provision": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Warmth methods": {"Type": "options"},
      "Temperature range": {"Type": "text"},
      "Additional instructions": {"Type": "text"}
    }
  }
}


I removed `Deadline date` and `Reminders` as they are not applicable parameters. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
