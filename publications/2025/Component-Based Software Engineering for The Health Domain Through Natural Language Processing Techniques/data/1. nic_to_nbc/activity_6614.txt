Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Oxygen Therapy Guidance": {
    "parameters": {
      "oxygen_need": "",
      "oxygen_flow_rate": "",
      "oxygen_delivery_method": "",
      "duration": ""
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the `monitoring` parameter as it is marked as optional, and there was no specific value provided for any of the parameters. If you want to keep the `monitoring` parameter, here is the updated output:


{
  "Oxygen Therapy Guidance": {
    "parameters": {
      "oxygen_need": "",
      "oxygen_flow_rate": "",
      "oxygen_delivery_method": "",
      "duration": "",
      "monitoring": ""
    }
  }
}
