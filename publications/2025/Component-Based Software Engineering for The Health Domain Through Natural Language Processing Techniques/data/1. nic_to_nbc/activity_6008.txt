Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Medication Administration": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {},
      "Rights": {},
      "Verification": {},
      "Condition": {},
      "Frequency": {}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it was not applicable (no value was specified). Let me know if you'd like me to keep it anyway!
