Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Medication Therapy Instruction": {
        "parameters": [
            { "name": "name", "type": "text" },
            { "name": "content", "type": "text" },
            { "name": "medications", "type": "list of medications" },
            { "name": "dosage_instructions", "type": "text" },
            { "name": "frequency", "type": "options" },
            { "name": "reminders", "type": "options" },
            { "name": "family_involved", "type": "boolean" }
        ]
    }
}

Note that I removed the `required` field as it was not specified in the problem statement. If you need to include it, please let me know and I'll update the output accordingly.
