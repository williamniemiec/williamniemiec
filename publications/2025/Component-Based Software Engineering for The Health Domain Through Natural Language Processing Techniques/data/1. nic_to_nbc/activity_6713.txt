Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Call Light Accessibility": {
        "Parameters": {
            "Call Light Location": {"Type": "options", "Options": ["Within reach of the patient", "Out of reach of the patient"]},
            "Call Light System Marking": {"Type": "options", "Options": ["Yes, marked to indicate patient cannot speak", "No, not marked"]},
            "Communication Needs": {"Type": "text"},
            "Frequency": {"Type": "options", "Options": ["Daily", "Shiftly", "Only when necessary"]}
        }
    }
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it's not applicable in this context. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
