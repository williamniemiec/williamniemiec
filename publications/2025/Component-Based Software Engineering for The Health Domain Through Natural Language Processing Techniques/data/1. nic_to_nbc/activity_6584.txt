Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Expressed Milk Handling Guide": {
    "Guide Title": {},
    "Steps": {},
    "Collection": {},
    "Storage": {},
    "Thawing": {},
    "Preparation": {},
    "Fortification": {},
    "Warming": {},
    "Frequency": {},
    "Deadline Date": {}
  }
}


Note that I removed the not applicable parameters (i.e., those with `Required: false`) and kept only the parameter names without their descriptions. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
