Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Demonstration": {
    "Content": {"Type": "multimedia"},
    "Skill or Task": {"Type": "text"},
    "Return Demonstration": {"Type": "boolean"},
    "Assessment": {"Type": "boolean"},
    "Feedback": {"Type": "boolean"}
  }
}


Note that I removed the parameters that were not applicable (i.e., had no value). Let me know if you have any further questions!
