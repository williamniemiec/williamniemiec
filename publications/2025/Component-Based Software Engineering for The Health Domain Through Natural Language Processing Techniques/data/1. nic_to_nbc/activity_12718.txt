Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Skin Inspection": {
    "name": "Skin Inspection",
    "description": "Inspect your skin for any issues",
    "questions": [
      "Do you have any skin irritation?",
      "Do you have any skin lesions?",
      "Do you have any corns or calluses?",
      "Do you have any skin deformities?",
      "Do you have any swelling (edema)?"
    ],
    "answer type": ["Yes", "No", "Not sure"],
    "frequency": "",
    "deadline_date": ""
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Content type` parameter as it was not applicable, and also left the `frequency` and `deadline_date` parameters empty as they didn't have any specified values. Let me know if you'd like me to modify this output in any way!
