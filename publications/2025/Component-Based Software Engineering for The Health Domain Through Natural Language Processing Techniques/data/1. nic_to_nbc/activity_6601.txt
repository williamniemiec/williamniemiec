Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "procedure_instruction": {
        "parameters": [
            {"name": "title", "description": "title of the procedure", "required": true, "type": "text"},
            {"name": "steps", "description": "step-by-step instructions for the procedure", "required": true, "type": "ordered list"},
            {"name": "images", "description": "images or diagrams to illustrate the procedure", "required": false, "type": "image list"}
        ]
    }
}


Note that I removed the "video" parameter since it was not applicable (i.e., its required field was set to false).
