Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Monitoring": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Monitoring Type": {"Type": "options"},
      "Frequency": {"Type": "options"},
      "Data": {"Type": "depends on the specific data being monitored"},
      "Alert Thresholds": {"Type": "depends on the specific data being monitored"}
    }
  }
}


Let me know if this is what you were expecting!
