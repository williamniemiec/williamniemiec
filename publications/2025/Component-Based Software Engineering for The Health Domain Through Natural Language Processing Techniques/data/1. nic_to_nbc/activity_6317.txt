Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Pain Relief Guide": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "pain relief guide title",
      "description": "instructions on nonpharmacologic pain relief methods (e.g., sitz baths, ambulation, massage, imagery, ice packs, witch hazel pads, and distraction)",
      "methods": "a list of nonpharmacologic pain relief methods with descriptions and instructions",
      "video/tutorial": "an optional feature to provide video tutorials or demonstrations of each method",

    }
  },
  "Questionnaire": {

}


Note: I removed the parameters for the Questionnaire no-code element since they were not applicable in this context.
