Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "sexual_needs": [
        {
            "name": "sexual_needs",
            "description": "specify the patient's individual sexual needs"
        },
        {
            "name": "acceptable_ways",
            "description": "list of acceptable ways to fulfill individual sexual needs in privacy"
        },
        {
            "name": "boundaries",
            "description": "specify boundaries for fulfilling individual sexual needs in privacy"
        },
        {
            "name": "resources",
            "description": "list of resources to support fulfilling individual sexual needs in privacy"
        },
        {
            "name": "frequency",
            "description": "specify how often the discussion should be repeated"
        }
    ]
}


I removed the `deadline_date` parameter because it was marked as not required (`"required": false`). Let me know if you have any further questions!
