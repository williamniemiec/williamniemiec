Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Breathing Exercise Guide": {
        "Name": {"Type": "text"},
        "Steps": {"Type": "ordered list of text or images"},
        "Frequency": {"Options": ["daily", "everyOtherDay", "every2Days", "every3Days", "..."]},
        "Deadline Date": {"Type": "datetime"},
        "Tips and Reminders": {"Type": "text or link to external resource"},
        "Exercise Log": {"Type": "table or form with columns for date, time, and notes"}
    }
}


I removed the introduction, conclusion, and not applicable parameters from the text. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
