Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Physiological Status Guidance": {
    "Content": {"type": "text or HTML"},
    "Vital Signs": {"type": "list of options"},
    "Frequency": {"type": "options"},
    "Resources": {"type": "list of URLs or PDFs"}
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Quiz` parameter since it's not applicable (it's a boolean or a quiz mechanism, which is not a typical parameter specification). Let me know if you have any further questions!
