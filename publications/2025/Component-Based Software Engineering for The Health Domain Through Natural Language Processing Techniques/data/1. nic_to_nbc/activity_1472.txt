Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Food Temperature Controller": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Food Type": {},
      "Temperature Range": {},
      "Meal Times": {},
      "Instructions": {}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the "Reminders" parameter as it has a default value of false, which can be considered as not applicable.
