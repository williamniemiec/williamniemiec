Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Trigger Tracker": {
    "Trigger List": {},
    "Reaction Type": {},
    "Trigger Rating": {},
    "Reaction Description": {},
    "Frequency": {}
  }
}


I removed `Deadline Date` as it's not applicable, and kept only the parameters that are relevant. Let me know if you need further assistance!
