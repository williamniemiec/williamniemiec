Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Side Effect Action Plan": {
        "parameters": [
            {"Name": {"type": "text"}},
            {"Medication Name": {"type": "text"}},
            {"Side Effect": {"type": "text"}},
            {"Actions to Take": {"type": "list of text"}},
            {"Contact Information": {"type": "text"}},
            {"Frequency": {"type": "options", "options": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"]}}
        ]
    }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it was marked as not required in the original input. Let me know if you'd like me to include it anyway!
