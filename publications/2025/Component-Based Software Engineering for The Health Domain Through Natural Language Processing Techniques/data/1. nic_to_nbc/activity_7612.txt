Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Overstimulation Prevention Plan": {
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "Plan Items", "type": "list of plan items"},
      {"name": "Customization Options", "type": "options"},
      {"name": "Frequency", "type": "options", "options": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"]},
      {"name": "Reminders", "type": "boolean"}
    ]
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it was not applicable (i.e., its type is `datetime`, but there were no specific options provided). Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!
