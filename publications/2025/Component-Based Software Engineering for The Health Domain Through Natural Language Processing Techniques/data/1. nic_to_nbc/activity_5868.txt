Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Infection Status Assessment": {
    "Temperature": {"Type": "number", "Required": true},
    "White Blood Cell Count": {"Type": "number", "Required": true},
    "Cultures": {"Type": "text", "Required": true},
    "Infection Signs and Symptoms": {"Type": "options", "Required": true, "Options": ["yes", "no"]},
    "Antibiotic Therapy": {"Type": "text", "Required": true},
    "Infection Status": {"Type": "calculated", "Required": true}
  }
}


I removed the introduction and conclusion sections, as well as the non-parameter specifications. I also excluded the "Notes" parameter since it's not required. Let me know if this meets your requirements!
