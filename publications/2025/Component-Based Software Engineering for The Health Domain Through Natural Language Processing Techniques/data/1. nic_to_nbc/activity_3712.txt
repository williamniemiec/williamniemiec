Here is the output in JSON format:

      "description": "Elevate and wrap extremity with an elastic bandage before cuff inflation",
      "content_type": "step-by-step guide",

        {

        }
      ],
      "frequency": "as needed" or "according to healthcare provider's instructions"
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `deadline_date` parameter since it was marked as "not applicable".
