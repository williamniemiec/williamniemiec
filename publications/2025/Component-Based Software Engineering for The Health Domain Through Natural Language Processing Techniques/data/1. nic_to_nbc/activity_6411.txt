Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Medication Adjustment Criteria": {
        "parameters": [
            {"Name": {"type": "text"}},
            {"Criteria": {"type": "list of options"}},
            {"Description": {"type": "list of text"}},
            {"Medication Name": {"type": "text"}},
            {"Frequency": {"type": "options"}}
        ]
    }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it was not applicable (its `required` field was set to `false`). Let me know if you need any further assistance!
