Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Impaction Symptom Tracker": {
    "parameters": [
      {"Symptom Checklist": "A parameter that specifies the symptoms of impaction to be tracked"},
      {"Frequency": "A parameter that specifies how often the patient should track their symptoms"},
      {"Severity Scale": "A parameter that specifies the severity scale to be used to rate the symptoms"},
      {"Notes": "A parameter that specifies any additional notes or comments about the patient's symptoms"}
    ]
  }
}


I removed the `Abdominal Exam` parameter as it is a boolean type and not applicable in this context. Let me know if you need anything else!
