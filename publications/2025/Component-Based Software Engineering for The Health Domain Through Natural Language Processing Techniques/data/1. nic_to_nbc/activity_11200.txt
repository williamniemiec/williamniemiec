Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "IV Site Care Guide": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {"Type": "text"},
      "Steps": {"Type": "ordered list of text or images"},
      "Frequency": {"Options": ["daily", "every 12 hours", "every 8 hours", "..."]},
      "Agency Protocol": {"Type": "text or PDF"}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it was not applicable (its type is `datetime`, but there were no specific options listed).
