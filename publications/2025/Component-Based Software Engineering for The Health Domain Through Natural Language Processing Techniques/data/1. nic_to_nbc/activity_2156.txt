Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Hand Antisepsis Guide": {
    "Protocol": {"type": ["text", "video"]},
    "Step-by-Step Instructions": {"type": ["video", "interactive tutorial"]},
    "Timing": {"type": ["text", "timer"]},
    "Product Information": {"type": ["text", "image"]}
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Quality Control` parameter as it is not applicable since its type is a boolean or rating scale, which doesn't fit with the other parameters that are all related to content.
