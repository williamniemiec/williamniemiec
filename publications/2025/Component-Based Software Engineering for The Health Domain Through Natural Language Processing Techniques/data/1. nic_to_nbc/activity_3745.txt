Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Questionnaire": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "Symptom Assessment",
      "description": "Please answer the following questions about your symptoms",
      "content_type": ["form", "survey"],
      "questions": [
        "Do you experience intermittent claudication?",
        "Do you experience rest pain?",
        "Do you experience night pain?"
      ],
      "answer_type": ["boolean", "select"],
      "frequency": "",
      "deadline_date": "",
      "notes": ""
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the `not applicable` parameters, which were the ones without a value specified. Also, I kept the `questions` parameter as an array of strings, and the `content_type` and `answer_type` parameters as arrays of possible values. If you need any further modifications, please let me know!
