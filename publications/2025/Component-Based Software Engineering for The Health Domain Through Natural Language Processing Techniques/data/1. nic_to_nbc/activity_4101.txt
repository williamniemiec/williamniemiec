Here is the output in JSON format:

{
  "name": "Reflection",
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "Topic",
      "type": "text"
    },
    {
      "name": "Prompt",
      "type": "text"
    },
    {
      "name": "Reflection type",
      "type": "options"
    },
    {
      "name": "Resources",
      "type": "multimedia"
    },
    {
      "name": "Frequency",
      "type": "options"
    }
  ]
}

I removed the `description` and other fields that were not specified in the output format. I also removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it was marked as not applicable (i.e., no value was provided). Let me know if this meets your requirements!
