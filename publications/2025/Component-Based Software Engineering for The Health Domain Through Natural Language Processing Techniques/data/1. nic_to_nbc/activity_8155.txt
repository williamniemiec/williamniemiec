Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "name": "teratogens_info_service",
    "parameters": [
        { 
            "name": "service_name", 
            "description": "name of the teratogens information service"
        },
        { 
            "name": "service_url", 
            "description": "URL of the teratogens information service"
        },
        { 
            "name": "search_criteria", 
            "description": "search criteria for environmental agents"
        },
        { 
            "name": "search_results", 
            "description": "search results from the teratogens information service",
            "list": [
                { 
                    "label": "Agent name"
                },
                { 
                    "label": "Description"
                },
                { 
                    "label": "Risks"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}


Note that I removed the `required` and `type` fields from the parameters, as they were not requested in the output. If you need them, let me know!
