Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Rehabilitation Referral": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Rehabilitation Type": {},
      "Rehabilitation Center": {},
      "Reason for Referral": {},
      "Patient Information": {},
      "Referral Date": {}
    }
  }
}


I removed the "Follow-up Instructions" parameter since it was marked as not required. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
