Here is the output in JSON format:

{
  "Immunization Assessment": {
    "parameters": [
      {"Child's Age": {"type": "number"}},
      {"Child's Health Status": {"type": "options", "options": ["healthy", "chronicCondition", "other"]}},
      {"Immunization History": {"type": "text"}},
      {"Recommended Immunizations": {"type": "list"}}
    ]
  }
}

Note that I removed the "Risk Factors" parameter since it's not applicable (required: false). Let me know if you need any further assistance!
