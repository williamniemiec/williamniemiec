Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Vision Impact Tracker": {
        "parameters": {
            "name": "",
            "description": "",
            "assessment_questions": {
                "risk_of_injury": "",
                "depression_anxiety": "",
                "adl_impact": "",
                "valued_activities": ""
            },
            "frequency": "",
            "tracking_tool": "",
            "alerts": ""
        }
    }
}


Note that I removed the non-applicable parameters and only kept the `parameters` section, as per your request. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
