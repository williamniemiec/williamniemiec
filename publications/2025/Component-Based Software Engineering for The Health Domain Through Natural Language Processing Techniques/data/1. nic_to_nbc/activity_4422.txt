Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Thought Record": {
    "Irrational Self-Statement": {},
    "Emotion": {},
    "Rational Self-Statement": {},
    "Evidence": {},
    "Alternative Action": {},
    "Frequency": {
      "options": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"]
    },
    "Deadline Date": {}
  }
}


I removed the introduction, conclusion, and other irrelevant parts of the text, and only kept the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` (Thought Record) and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed any parameters that were marked as "Not Applicable" since there were none in this example.
