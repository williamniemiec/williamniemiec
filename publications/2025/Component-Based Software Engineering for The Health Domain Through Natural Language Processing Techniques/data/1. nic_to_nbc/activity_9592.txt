Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Respite Care Resources": {
    "Resource Directory": {"type": "list of options or links to resources"},
    "Search Function": {"type": "search bar or filter"},
    "Resource Details": {"type": "text or table"},
    "Reviews and Ratings": {"type": "rating system or comment section"},
    "Filtering and Sorting": {"type": "dropdown menus or checkboxes"}
  }
}


Note that I removed the "Reminders and Notifications" parameter since it has a type of boolean (yes/no) or frequency, which can be considered as not applicable.
