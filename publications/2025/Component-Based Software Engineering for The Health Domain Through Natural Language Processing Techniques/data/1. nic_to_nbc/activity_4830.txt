Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Message": {
    "name": "message title",
    "content": "message text",
    "trigger": "condition for displaying the message",
    "frequency": "how often the message should be displayed"
  },
  "Badge": {
    "name": "badge title",
    "description": "badge description",
    "icon": "icon or image to be displayed for the badge",
    "trigger": "condition for awarding the badge",
    "frequency": "how often the badge should be awarded"
  }
}


I removed `deadline_date` parameter as it was not applicable in this context. Let me know if you need anything else!
