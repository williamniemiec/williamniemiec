      "instructions": {
        "type": "text",
        "value": "Gently clean the incision with soap and water. Avoid using harsh or abrasive cleansers. Pat the area dry with a clean towel. Avoid submerging the incision in water until it is fully healed."

      },

      },
      "notes": {

  }
}
