Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "sex_education": [
        {
            "name": "developmental_level"
        },
        {
            "name": "topics"
        },
        {
            "name": "content"
        },
        {
            "name": "resources"
        },
        {
            "name": "frequency"
        }
    ]
}


I removed the parameters that were not applicable (i.e., `deadline_date` since it's not required) and only kept the `name` property of each parameter. Let me know if this meets your requirements!
