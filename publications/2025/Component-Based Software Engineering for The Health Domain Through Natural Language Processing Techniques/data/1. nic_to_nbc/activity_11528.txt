Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Self-Hypnosis Response Tracker": {
    "Response Rating": {"Type": "rating scale (e.g., 1-5)"},
    "Symptom Tracking": {"Type": "numerical value or rating scale"},
    "Frequency of Practice": {"Type": "frequency picker (e.g., daily, 3 times a week)"},
    "Duration of Practice": {"Type": "time picker (e.g., 10 minutes, 20 minutes)"},
    "Notes": {"Type": "text"},
    "Goal Progress": {"Type": "percentage complete or rating scale"}
  }
}


I removed the `Alerts` parameter since it's a boolean type and not applicable in this context. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
