Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Reminder": {
    "Name": {"Type": "text"},
    "Description": {"Type": "text"},
    "Trigger": {"Type": "options", "Options": ["during meal times", "before eating", "custom"]},
    "Instructions": {"Type": "text"}
  }
}


Note that I removed the "Guide" and "Task" elements as they were not part of the original request. Also, I only kept the parameters that were applicable to the "Reminder" element. Let me know if you need anything else!
