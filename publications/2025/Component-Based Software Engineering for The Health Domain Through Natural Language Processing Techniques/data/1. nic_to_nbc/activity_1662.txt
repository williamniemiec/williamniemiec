Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Vehicle Safety Education": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Vehicle Type": {"Type": "options"},
      "Risk Factors": {"Type": "list of text"},
      "Safety Tips": {"Type": "list of text"},
      "Resources": {"Type": "text or links to resources"},
      "Quiz": {"Type": "multiple choice or true/false questions"},
      "Frequency": {"Type": "options"}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it is not applicable (its type is `datetime`, which doesn't fit with the other parameters' types). Let me know if you have any further requests!
