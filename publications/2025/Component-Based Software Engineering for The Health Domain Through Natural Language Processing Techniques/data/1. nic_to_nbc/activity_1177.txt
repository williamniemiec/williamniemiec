Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Attention Grabber": {
    "Video Demonstrations": {"Description": "video demonstrations of techniques to elicit infant's visual or auditory attention, such as making eye contact or using toys", "Required": true, "Type": "list of videos"},
    "Technique List": {"Description": "list of techniques to elicit infant's visual or auditory attention, such as clapping or using music", "Required": true, "Type": "list of text and images"}
  }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters (Tips and Reminders and Practice Exercises) since they are marked as "Required: false". Let me know if you have any further questions!
