Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Literacy Support System": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Title": {"Type": "text"},
      "Resources": {
        "Type": "list of resources",
        "Resource": {
          "Type": {"Type": "options", "Options": ["staff", "materials", "technology", "etc."]},
          "Description": {"Type": "text"}
        }
      },
      "Accommodations": {
        "Type": "list of accommodations",
        "Accommodation": {
          "Type": {"Type": "options", "Options": ["extra time", "simplified instructions", "visual aids", "etc."]},
          "Description": {"Type": "text"}
        }
      },
      "Staff Training": {"Type": "text"},
      "Patient Education": {"Type": "text"},
      "Feedback Mechanism": {"Type": "text"}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the parameters that were marked as "Not Applicable" (there were none in this case), and reformatted the remaining parameters into a JSON object. Let me know if you have any further questions!
