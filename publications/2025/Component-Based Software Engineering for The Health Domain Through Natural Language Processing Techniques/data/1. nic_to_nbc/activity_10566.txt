Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Assistance Needs Assessment": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Assistance Level": {},
      "Type of Assistance": {},
      "Activities Requiring Assistance": {},
      "Frequency of Assistance": {},
      "Additional Notes": {}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Date and Time` parameter as it's not applicable in this context, assuming it's automatically generated by the system.
