Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Symptom Management Guide": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Symptom Checker": {
        "Type": "checklist or multi-select options"
      },
      "Treatment Options": {
        "Type": "text or options"
      },
      "Dosage and Administration": {
        "Type": "text or options"
      },
      "When to Seek Medical Attention": {
        "Type": null
      }
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the "When to Seek Medical Attention" parameter since its type was not specified.
