Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Instruction": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Instruction text": "Apply graduated elastic compression stockings or sleeves to reduce the risk of postthrombotic syndrome or recurrence of DVT.",
      "Image or video": null,
      "Frequency": ["daily", "every 2 hours", "every 4 hours"],
      "Duration": ["8 hours", "12 hours", "24 hours"]
    }
  },
  "Task": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Instruction text": "Apply graduated elastic compression stockings or sleeves to reduce the risk of postthrombotic syndrome or recurrence of DVT.",
      "Image or video": null,
      "Frequency": ["daily", "every 2 hours", "every 4 hours"],
      "Duration": ["8 hours", "12 hours", "24 hours"],
      "Reminder": null
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the `*` characters from the parameter specifications and formatted the output as a JSON object. I also assumed that empty parameters (e.g. `Image or video`) should be represented as `null`. Let me know if you'd like me to make any changes!
