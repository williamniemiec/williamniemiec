Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Dressing Assistance": {
    "parameters": {
      "Clothing Type": {"type": "text"},
      "Nonrestrictive": {"type": "boolean"},
      "Assistance Level": {"type": "scale"},
      "Dressing Instructions": {"type": "text"}
    }
  }
}


I removed the "Notes" parameter as it is not applicable, and also removed the introduction, conclusion, and other unnecessary parts of the text. Let me know if this meets your requirements!
