Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Guide": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "Special Care for Infant Guide",
      "pages": [],
      "frequency": "onlyOnce"
    }
  },
  "Task": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "Perform Special Care for Infant",
      "content": "Please perform the following special care tasks for your infant: [list specific tasks, e.g. oxygen therapy, suctioning, etc.].",
      "tasks": ["Oxygen therapy", "Suctioning", "Wound care"],
      "frequency": "daily" || "everyDays"
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `deadline_date` parameter since it was specified as "not required". Also, I didn't include any other elements except for the `parameters` section. Let me know if you need anything else!
