Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "name": "Instruction",
    "parameters": [
        { 
            "name": "Title", 
            "type": "text"
        },
        { 
            "name": "Content", 
            "type": "text"
        },
        { 
            "name": "Reason", 
            "type": "text"
        }
    ]
}


I removed the `Warning` parameter since it's not required, and also removed the other fields that were not requested. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
