Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "name": "fluid_intake_instruction",
    "parameters": [
        { 
            "name": "duration", 
            "description": "specify the duration of increased fluid intake"
        },
        { 
            "name": "frequency", 
            "description": "specify how often to remind the patient to increase fluid intake"
        }
    ]
}


I removed all unnecessary parts and kept only the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the not applicable parameters, in this case, `custom_duration` and `deadline_date`, as they are not required.
