Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Task": {
        "Parameters": {
            "Task name": "Wash hair",
            "Frequency": "",
            "Instructions": ""
        }
    },
    "Guide": {
        "Parameters": {
            "Guide title": "How to wash your hair",
            "Steps": [],
            "Tips": []
        }
    }
}


Note: I removed the `*` characters and reformatted the output in JSON format. I also kept the empty parameters (`Frequency`, `Instructions`, `Steps`, and `Tips`) as they were, assuming that's what you meant by "don't write anything else". If you'd like me to remove them instead, let me know!
