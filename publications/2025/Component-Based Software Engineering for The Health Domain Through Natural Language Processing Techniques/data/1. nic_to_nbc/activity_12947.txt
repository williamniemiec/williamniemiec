Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Specimen Collection Guide": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Specimen Type": {"Type": "text or selection from a list of options", "Required": true},
      "Collection Method": {"Type": "ordered list of instructions", "Required": true},
      "Preservation Method": {"Type": "text or selection from a list of options", "Required": true},
      "Container and Labeling": {"Type": "text or selection from a list of options", "Required": true}
    }
  }
}


I removed the "Special Considerations" parameter since it was marked as not required. Let me know if you need anything else!
