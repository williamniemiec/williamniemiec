Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Home Safety Advisor": {
    "Safety Issues": {"Description": "List of potential home safety issues (e.g. tripping hazards, fall risks, medication management)", "Required": true, "Type": "list of text"},
    "Interventions": {"Description": "List of potential home safety interventions (e.g. removing tripping hazards, installing handrails, medication reminders)", "Required": true, "Type": "list of text"},
    "Discussion Notes": {"Description": "Notes from the discussion about home safety issues and interventions", "Required": true, "Type": "text"}
  }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters (i.e. `Content Type`, `Priority`) and kept only the necessary information. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
