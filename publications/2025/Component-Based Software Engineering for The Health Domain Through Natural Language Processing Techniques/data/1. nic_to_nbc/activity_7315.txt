Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Balance Instruction Guide": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Balance Techniques": {"Type": "list of balance techniques"},
      "Instructional Content": {"Type": "instructional content"},
      "Movement Guides": {"Type": "movement guides"},
      "Balance Exercises": {"Type": "balance exercises"}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Progress Tracking` parameter as it was not applicable to the no-code element.
