Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Stool Tracker": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "",
      "color": [],
      "amount": [],
      "character": [],
      "frequency": []
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `deadline_date` and `notes` parameters as they are not applicable in this context. Let me know if you have any further questions!
