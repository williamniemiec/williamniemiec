Here is the output in JSON format:


{
"Lung Segment Assessment": {
"parameters": {
"Lung Segment": {},
"Secretion Level": {},
"Frequency": {},
}
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it was marked "not applicable" (since its type is datetime, which doesn't fit with the other parameters). Let me know if this is correct!
