Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "confidential info portal": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Confidentiality Statement": {"Type": "text"},
      "Contraceptive Information": {"Type": "list of resources with links or embedded content"},
      "Secure Messaging": {"Type": "encrypted messaging system"},
      "Anonymity Options": {"Type": "checkbox or toggle for anonymity"},
      "Resources": {"Type": "list of resources with links or embedded content"}
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Frequency` and `Deadline Date` parameters as they are not applicable to this no-code element.
