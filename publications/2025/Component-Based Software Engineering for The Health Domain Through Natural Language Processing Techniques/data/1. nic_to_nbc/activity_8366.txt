Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Risk Assessment": {
        "parameters": {
            "Risk Factors": {"type": "list of text options"},
            "Assessment Questions": {"type": "list of questions with answer options"},
            "Priority Ranking": {"type": "list of risk factors with ranking options"},
            "Action Plan": {"type": "list of text fields for each risk factor"}
        }
    }
}


Note: I removed the `Collaboration` parameter as it doesn't seem to be a specific parameter specification, but rather a description of how the module can facilitate collaboration. If you want to include it, let me know!
