Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Relaxation Observation": {
    "Relaxation Assessment": {"Type": ["numeric value", "text"]},
    "Discomfort/Nausea Assessment": {"Type": ["numeric value", "text"]},
    "Verbalization Criteria": {"Type": ["text", "options"]},
    "Observation Frequency": {"Type": ["options"]},
    "Observation Duration": {"Type": ["text", "numeric value"]}
  }
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it was marked as not applicable. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
