Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Universal Precautions Tracker": {
        "parameters": {
            "Precaution Type": {},
            "Frequency": {},
            "Compliance": {},
            "Notes": {}
        }
    }
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it's not applicable in this context. Let me know if you have any further questions!
