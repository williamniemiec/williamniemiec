Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Cost Effectiveness Analysis": {
    "Care Intervention": {"type": "text"},
    "Cost Data": {"type": "numerical"},
    "Outcome Data": {"type": "text"},
    "Cost-Effectiveness Metrics": {"type": "unordered list", "options": ["cost per quality-adjusted life year", "cost per patient outcome", "etc."]},
    "Threshold Values": {"type": "numerical"}
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Alerts and Notifications` parameter as it had options, but I assumed you wanted to remove not applicable parameters. If that's not the case, let me know!
