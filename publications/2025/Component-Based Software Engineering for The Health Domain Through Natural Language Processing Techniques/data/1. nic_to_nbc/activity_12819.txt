Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "noCodeElementName": "Circulation and Neurological Function Tracker",
  "parameters": {
    "Tissue Areas": ["Above the cast", "Below the cast"],
    "Circulation Indicators": ["Pulse", "Temperature", "Color"],
    "Neurological Function Indicators": ["Sensation", "Movement", "Reflexes"],
    "Frequency": "",
    "Deadline Date": "",
    "Reporting": ""
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Introduction` and `Conclusion` sections, as well as the not applicable parameters (`Frequency`, `Deadline Date`, and `Reporting`). Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
