Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "name": "Bone Marrow Functioning Education",
    "parameters": [
        { 
            "name": "Education Content", 
            "type": "text or multimedia"
        },
        { 
            "name": "Therapy Type", 
            "type": "text or list of text"
        },
        { 
            "name": "Bone Marrow Functioning Assessment", 
            "type": "numerical value or text"
        },
        { 
            "name": "Personalized Recommendations", 
            "type": "text or list of text"
        },
        { 
            "name": "Family Education", 
            "type": "text or multimedia"
        }
    ]
}

Note that I removed the `description` and `required` fields, as well as the `content_type` field, since they were not specified in the output format. Let me know if you need anything else!
