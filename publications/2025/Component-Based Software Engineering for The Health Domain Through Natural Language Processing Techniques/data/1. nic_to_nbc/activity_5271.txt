Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Feedback Loop": {
    "feedback_name": {},
    "trigger": {},
    "feedback_message": {},
    "corrective_actions": {},
    "frequency": {},
    "deadline_date": {}
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Description` and other non-parameter fields, as well as the `Required` and `Type` information for each parameter. Let me know if you'd like me to include any of that information in the output!
