Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "name": "Family Questionnaire",
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "Questions",
      "type": "form"
    },
    {
      "name": "Frequency",
      "type": "options",
      "options": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Family Member",
      "type": "text"
    }
  ]
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter because it was marked as not applicable (`required: false`). Let me know if you need any further modifications!
