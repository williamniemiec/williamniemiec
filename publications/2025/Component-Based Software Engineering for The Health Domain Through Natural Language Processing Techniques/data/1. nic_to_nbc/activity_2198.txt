Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Situation Comparison": {
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "Past Stressful Situations", "type": "unordered list"},
      {"name": "Current Situation", "type": "text"},
      {"name": "Comparison Points", "type": "unordered list"},
      {"name": "Reflection Questions", "type": "text"},
      {"name": "Frequency", "type": "options", "options": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"]},
    ]
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it was not applicable (its required field was set to false).
