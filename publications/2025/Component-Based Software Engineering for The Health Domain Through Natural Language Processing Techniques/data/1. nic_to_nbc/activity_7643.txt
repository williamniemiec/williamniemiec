Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Observation Recording": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Observation Type": {},
      "Recording Method": {},
      "Observation Categories": {},
      "Recording Frequency": {}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the "Note-taking Template" parameter as it was marked as "not applicable" since its type is "text", not "options". Let me know if you have any further questions!
