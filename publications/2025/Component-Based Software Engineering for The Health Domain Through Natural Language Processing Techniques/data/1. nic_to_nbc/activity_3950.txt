Here is the output in JSON format:

{
  "Stage Tracker": {
    "name": "",
    "stages": [],
    "current_stage": "",
    "next_stage": "",
    "progress": ""
  },
  "Reflection Question": {
    "name": "",
    "question": "",
    "answer_type": "",
    "frequency": ""
  },
  "Group Development Guide": {
    "name": "",
    "content": [],
    "stage_links": [],
    "progress_tracking": ""
  }
}

Note that I removed the introduction and conclusion, as well as the numbering and descriptions of the no-code elements. I only kept the names of the no-code elements and their corresponding parameter specifications. I also removed the "Not Applicable" parameters. Let me know if this is what you were expecting!
