Here is the output in JSON format:

{
  "ICP Baseline Tracker": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "Allow ICP to return to baseline between nursing activities",
      "icp_reading": {"type": "number"},
      "baseline_icp": {"type": "number"},
      "nursing_activity": {"type": "options", "options": [...]},
      "frequency": {"type": "options", "options": [...]},
    }
  }
}

Note that I removed the `description` and other fields from each parameter, as they were not specified to be kept. I also removed the `deadline_date` parameter since it was marked as not required (`"required": false`). Let me know if you have any further questions or clarifications!
