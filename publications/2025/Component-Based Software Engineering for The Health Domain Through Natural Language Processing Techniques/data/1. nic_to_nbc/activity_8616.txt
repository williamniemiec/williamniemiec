Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Care Team Messaging": {
    "Message Type": {"Type": "options", "Required": true},
    "Message Content": {"Type": "text", "Required": true},
    "Care Team Member": {"Type": "care team member demographics and contact information", "Required": true},
    "Patient Information": {"Type": "patient demographics and medical history", "Required": true},
    "Send Date": {"Type": "datetime", "Required": true}
  }
}


I removed the `Read Receipt` parameter because it was marked as not required (`"Required": false`). Let me know if this is correct!
