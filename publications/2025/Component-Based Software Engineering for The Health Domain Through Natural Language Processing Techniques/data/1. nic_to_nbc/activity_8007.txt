Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Food Preference Plan": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Food Preferences": "",
      "Portion Size": "",
      "Meal Frequency": "",
      "Food Avoidance": ""
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Tracking` parameter as it's not applicable (its type is boolean or rating scale, but no specific value was provided). Let me know if you have any further questions!
