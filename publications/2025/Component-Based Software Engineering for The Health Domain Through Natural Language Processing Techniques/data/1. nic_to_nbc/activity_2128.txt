Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Hemodynamic Monitoring": {
    "Parameter List": {"Type": "list of text"},
    "Target Range": {"Type": "range (with units, e.g. mmHg, bpm)"},
    "Monitoring Schedule": {"Type": "text"},
    "Data Entry": {"Type": "text or numerical input"},
    "Alerts": {"Type": "boolean (yes/no)"},
    "Physician Consult": {"Type": "boolean (yes/no)"},
    "Notes": {"Type": "text"}
  }
}


I removed all unnecessary text and kept only the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` ("Hemodynamic Monitoring") and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}` (the parameters with their types). I also removed the "Not Applicable" parameters, as there were none in this input. Let me know if you need further assistance!
