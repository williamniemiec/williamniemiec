Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Skill Demonstration": {
    "Parameters": {
      "skill_name": {},
      "instructions_text": {},
      "video_submission": {},
      "assessment_criteria": {},
      "frequency": {
        "options": ["daily", "everyOtherDay", "every3Days", "custom"]
      },
      "deadline_date": {}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Description` and other non-parameter fields, as well as the `Required` and `Type` fields for each parameter. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
