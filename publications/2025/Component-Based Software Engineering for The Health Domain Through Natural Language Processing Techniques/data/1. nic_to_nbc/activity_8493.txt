Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Body Mechanics Guide": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {},
      "Positioning Technique": {},
      "Instructions": {},
      "Frequency": {}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it was marked as a datetime type, which is not applicable in this context. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
