Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Home Safety Guide": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {"Type": "text"},
      "Safety Tips": {"Type": "list of text and images"},
      "Room-by-Room Guide": {"Type": "list of text and images"},
      "Videos and Images": {"Type": "list of video and image files"},
      "Interactive Quizzes": {"Type": "quiz with multiple-choice questions"},
      "Frequency": {"Type": "options", "Options": ["daily", "every other day", "weekly", "etc."]},
      "Safety Checklist": {"Type": "checklist with input fields for date and completion status"},
      "Personalized Recommendations": {"Type": "text and images"}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the non-applicable parameters, which are the introduction, number, description, content type, and conclusion. I also reformatted the parameter specifications to fit a JSON structure.
