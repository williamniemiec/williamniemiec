Here is the output in JSON format:

{
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "name",
      "type": "text"
    },
    {
      "name": "content",
      "type": "text"
    },
    {
      "name": "image",
      "type": "image"
    },
    {
      "name": "location",
      "type": "text"
    },
    {
      "name": "frequency",
      "type": "options"
    }
  ],
  "no-code element name": "Preparation"
}

Note that I removed the `description` and `required` fields as they were not present in the original format, and also removed the `options` array from the `frequency` parameter as it was not applicable. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
