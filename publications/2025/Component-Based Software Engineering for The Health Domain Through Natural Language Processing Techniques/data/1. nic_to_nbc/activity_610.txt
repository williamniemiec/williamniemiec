Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Family/Significant Others Assessment": {
        "Caregiver roles": {"type": "list of text or selection from a list of roles"},
        "Caregiver strengths": {"type": "list of text or selection from a list of strengths"},
        "Caregiver weaknesses": {"type": "list of text or selection from a list of weaknesses"}
    },
    "Caregiver Evaluation": {
        "Evaluation criteria": {"type": "list of text or selection from a list of criteria"},
        "Evaluation score": {"type": "numerical value or selection from a list of ratings"}
    },
    "Caregiver Recommendation": {
        "Recommendation logic": {"type": "conditional statement (e.g., if-then statement)"},
        "Recommendation output": {"type": "list of text or selection from a list of recommendations"}
    }
}


I removed the introduction, conclusion, and any other unnecessary text, leaving only the no-code element names and their corresponding parameter specifications. I also formatted the output in JSON format as requested.
