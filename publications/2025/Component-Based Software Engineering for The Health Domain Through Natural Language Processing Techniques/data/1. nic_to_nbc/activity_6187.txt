Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Emotional Development Guide": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Title": {"Type": "text"},
      "Content": {"Type": "educational content (e.g., HTML, JSON)"},
      "Age Ranges": {"Type": "list of age ranges (e.g., text)"},
      "Developmental Milestones": {"Type": "list of developmental milestones (e.g., text)"},
      "Images/Videos": {"Type": "list of image/video URLs or embedded content"},
      "Quiz Questions": {"Type": "list of quiz questions (e.g., multiple-choice, true/false)"},
      "Frequency": {"Options": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyDays"]},
      "Deadline Date": {"Type": "datetime"}
    }
  }
}


I removed the introduction, number, description, and conclusion sections, as well as any non-parameter specifications. I also reformatted the parameter specifications to be more concise and JSON-friendly. Let me know if you have any further requests!
