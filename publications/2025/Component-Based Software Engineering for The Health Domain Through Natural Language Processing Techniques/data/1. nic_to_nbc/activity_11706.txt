Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Diagnostic Test Request": {
    "Test Type": "list of options or free text",
    "Test Reason": "list of options or free text",
    "Test Frequency": "list of options or free text",
    "Deadline Date": "datetime",
    "Test Results": "list of options or free text"
  }
}


Note that I removed the "Not Applicable" parameters and only kept the ones that had a specific type. Let me know if you need anything else!
