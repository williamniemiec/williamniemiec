Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Intake Tracker": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {},
      "Type": {},
      "Units": {},
      "Frequency": {}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it's not applicable (i.e., it doesn't have a value), and also removed other unnecessary parts of the input text. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
