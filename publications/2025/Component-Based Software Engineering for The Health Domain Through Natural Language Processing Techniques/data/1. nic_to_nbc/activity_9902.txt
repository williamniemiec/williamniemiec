Here is the output in JSON format:


{
"Open-Ended Question": {
    "Parameters": {
        "Question": ["How are you feeling today?", "What's been on your mind lately?", "Can you tell me more about your concerns?"],
        "Response Type": ["Text", "Audio", "Video"],
        "Frequency": ["daily", "weekly", "monthly"],
        "Deadline Date": "datetime"
    }
},
"Reflective Statement": {
    "Parameters": {
        "Statement": ["I sense that you're feeling overwhelmed.", "It sounds like you're struggling with...", "I'm here to listen and support you."],
        "Tone": ["Empathetic", "Non-judgmental", "Supportive"],
        "Frequency": ["daily", "weekly", "monthly"],
        "Deadline Date": "datetime"
    }
}
}


Note that I removed the "Content Type" parameter as it was not explicitly requested to be included in the output. If you need it, let me know!
