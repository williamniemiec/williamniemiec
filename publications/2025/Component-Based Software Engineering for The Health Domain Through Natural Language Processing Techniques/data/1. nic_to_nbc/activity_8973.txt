Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Safety Risk Assessment": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Assessment Questions": {"Type": "list of questions"},
      "Risk Threshold": {"Type": "number"},
      "Intervention Protocol": {"Type": "text"},
      "Frequency": {"Options": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"]},
      "Deadline Date": {"Type": "datetime"},
      "Escalation Protocol": {"Type": "text"}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the "Mood Tracker" and "Emotional State Assessment" elements as they are not part of the original no-code element description. Also, I didn't include any parameters that were marked as "Not Applicable".
