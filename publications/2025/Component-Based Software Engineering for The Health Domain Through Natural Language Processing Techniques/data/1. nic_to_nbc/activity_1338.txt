Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Prevention Measure": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "",
      "description": "",
      "type": "",
      "frequency": "",
      "instructions": ""
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `deadline_date` parameter as it's not applicable in this context. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
