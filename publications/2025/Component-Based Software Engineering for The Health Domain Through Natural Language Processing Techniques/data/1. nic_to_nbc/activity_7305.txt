Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Guide": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Guide title": "Fun Bathing Techniques for Kids",
      "Steps": ["Wash dolls or toys with your child", "Pretend a boat is a submarine", "Punch holes in the bottom of a plastic cup and fill with water"],
      "Tips": ["Encourage your child's imagination", "Make bath time a fun and engaging experience"],
      "Examples": ["Use a washcloth to create a 'rainbow' on your child's skin", "Sing songs or play music during bath time"]
    }
  },
  "Resource": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Resource title": "Fun Bathing Techniques for Kids",
      "Ideas": ["Wash dolls or toys", "Pretend play", "Sensory play with cups and water"],
      "Links": []
    }
  }
}


I removed all unnecessary text and kept only the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also formatted the output in JSON format as requested. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
