Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Consultation Model": {
    "Model Type": {},
    "Model Description": {},
    "Goals and Objectives": {},
    "Roles and Responsibilities": {},
    "Communication Plan": {},
    "Evaluation Criteria": {},
    "Frequency": {"options": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"]},
    "Deadline Date": {}
  }
}


Note that I removed the `INTRODUCTION` and `CONCLUSION` sections, as well as the `NUMBER` and `NO-CODE ELEMENT DESCRIPTION` elements. I also removed the `PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS` section headers and only kept the parameter names and their corresponding types/options. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
