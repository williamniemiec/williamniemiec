Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Family Time": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Family Notification": {
        "Description": "Notify family members of the opportunity to speak with the patient prior to transport",
        "Required": true,
        "Type": "text"
      },
      "Time Allocation": {
        "Description": "Specify the amount of time allocated for family members to speak with the patient",
        "Required": true,
        "Type": "duration"
      },
      "Family Instructions": {
        "Description": "Provide instructions to family members on how to make the most of their time with the patient",
        "Required": true,
        "Type": "text"
      }
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it's not required. Let me know if you have any further requests!
