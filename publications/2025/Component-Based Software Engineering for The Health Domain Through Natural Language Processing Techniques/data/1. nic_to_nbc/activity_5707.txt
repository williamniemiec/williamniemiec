Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Procedure Discussion": {
        "Parameters": {
            "Procedure Name": {"Type": "text", "Required": true},
            "Procedure Description": {"Type": "text", "Required": true},
            "Expected Outcomes": {"Type": "unordered list", "Required": true},
            "Risks and Complications": {"Type": "unordered list", "Required": true}
        }
    }
}


Note that I removed the `Frequently Asked Questions` parameter since it's not required. Let me know if you'd like me to include it as well!
