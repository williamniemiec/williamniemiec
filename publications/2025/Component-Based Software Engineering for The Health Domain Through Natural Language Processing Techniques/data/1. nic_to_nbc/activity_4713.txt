Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Learning Style Assessment": {
    "Questions": {},
    "Answer Options": {},
    "Learning Style Categories": {},
    "Scoring": {},
    "Frequency": {},
    "Deadline Date": {}
  },
  "Question": {
    "Name": {},
    "Answer Type": {},
    "Options": {},
    "Frequency": {},
    "Deadline Date": {}
  }
}


I removed all unnecessary text and only kept the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also reformatted the output to be in JSON format. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
