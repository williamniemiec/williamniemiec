Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Metabolic Alkalosis Monitor": {
    "lab_results": "",
    "vital_signs": "",
    "symptoms": "",
    "urinary_pH": "",
    "thresholds": ""
  }
}


Note that I removed the `interpretation` parameter as it was not applicable to this specific no-code element.
