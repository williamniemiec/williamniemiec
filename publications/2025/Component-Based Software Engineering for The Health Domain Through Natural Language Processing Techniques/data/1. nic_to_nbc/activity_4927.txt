Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Bolus Formation": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {"Type": "text"},
      "Indications": {"Type": "checklist"},
      "Food/Liquid Type": {"Type": "options", "Options": ["pudding", "yogurt", "thickened liquids", "others"]},
      "Bolus Formation Instructions": {"Type": "text"},
      "Frequency": {"Type": "options", "Options": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"]}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it's not applicable in this context, and reformatted the output to a JSON object with the no-code element name as the key, and its parameters as an inner object. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
