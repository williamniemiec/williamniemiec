Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Ostomy Care Guide": {
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "equipment overview", "description": "Overview of ostomy equipment", "required": true, "type": "text" or "video"},
      {"name": "step-by-step instructions", "description": "Step-by-step guide for using ostomy equipment", "required": true, "type": "interactive tutorial" or "video"}
    ]
  }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters (troubleshooting tips and follow-up questions) since they are marked as `required: false`. Let me know if this is what you were expecting!
