Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Blood Loss Education": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Blood Loss Severity": {"Type": "text or images"},
      "Actions Being Performed": {"Type": "text or images"},
      "Rationale": {"Type": "text"},
      "FAQs": {"Type": "list of text or images"}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the "not applicable" parameters, which means none were present in this example.
