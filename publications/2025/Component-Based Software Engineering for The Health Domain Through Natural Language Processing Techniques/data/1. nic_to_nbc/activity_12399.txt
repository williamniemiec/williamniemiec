Here is the output in JSON format:


{
"Virtual Room": {
    "Room Name": {"Description": "name of the virtual room", "Required": true, "Type": "text"},
    "Infant's Information": {"Description": "infant's information, such as photos, updates, and vital signs", "Required": true, "Type": "list of text and images"}
}
}


I removed the not applicable parameters (Parent's Journal and Resources) since they are marked as false in the Required field. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
