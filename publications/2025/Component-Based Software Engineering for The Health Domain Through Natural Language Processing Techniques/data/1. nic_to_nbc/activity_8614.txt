Here is the output in JSON format:

    "video": "",
    "frequency": ""
  },
  "Interactive Tutorial": {
    "name": "",
    "steps": [],
    "interactive elements": []
  },
  "Touch Guide": {

    "images": []
  },
  "Reflection Question": {

    "content": "",
    "answer type": ""

}


Note that I removed the `deadline_date` parameter as it is not applicable in this context. Also, I did not include any values for the parameters as they were not provided in the input text.
