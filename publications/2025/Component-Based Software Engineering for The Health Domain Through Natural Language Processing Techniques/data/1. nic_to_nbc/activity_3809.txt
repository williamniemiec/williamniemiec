Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Screening Questionnaire": {
        "Parameters": {
            "Questions": [],
            "Answer type": ["Boolean (yes/no)", "Text", "Select (from a list of options)"],
            "Frequency": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"],
            "Deadline Date": {"Type": "datetime"}
        }
    }
}


Note: I removed the "Not Applicable" parameters as per your request. Also, I represented the "Questions" parameter as an empty list since there was no specific value provided in the input text. If you want to include the example questions, let me know!
