Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Transfer Technique Guide": {
        "Parameters": [
            {"Name": "Transfer Technique Guide", "Description": "Title of the guide"},
            {"Content": "Transfer technique instructions", "Description": "Video or interactive simulation content teaching the patient proper transfer technique"},
            {"Transfer Type": "Specify the type of transfer", "Description": "Select the type of transfer (e.g., wheelchair, bed, toilet)"},
            {"Frequency": "How often to review the guide", "Description": "Specify how often the patient should review the transfer technique guide"}
        ]
    }
}


I removed all non-applicable parameters and only kept `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. Let me know if this is what you were expecting!
