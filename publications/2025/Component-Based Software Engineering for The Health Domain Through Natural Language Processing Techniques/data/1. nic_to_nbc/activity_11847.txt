Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Elevation Guide": {
    "Elevation Guide Title": {},
    "Affected Body Part": {},
    "Elevation Instructions": {},
    "Elevation Guide Media": {},
    "Elevation Angle": {},
    "Frequency": {}
  }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters (i.e., those with `Required: false`) and kept only the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
