Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Parameter Specifications": {
    "Condition": {
      "Description": "conditions that must be met before considering ear irrigation",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "list of text"
    },
    "Action": {
      "Description": "action to take if the conditions are met",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "text"
    },
    "Rationale": {
      "Description": "brief explanation of why ear irrigation may be necessary",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "text"
    }
  },
  "No-Code Element Name": "Conditional Action"
}


Note that I removed the `Precautions` parameter since it was marked as not required (`Required: false`).
