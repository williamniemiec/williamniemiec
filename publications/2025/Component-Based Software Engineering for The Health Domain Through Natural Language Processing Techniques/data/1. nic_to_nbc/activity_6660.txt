Here is the output in JSON format:

{
  "Infertility Support": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Emotional Support": {"Type": "text or audio content"},
      "History and Evaluation Guidance": {"Type": "text or video content"},
      "Stress Management Techniques": {"Type": "text or video content"},
      "Progress Tracking": {"Type": "chart or graph"},
      "Resources": {"Type": "list of resources with descriptions and contact information"}
    }
  }
}

I removed the "Reminders" parameter because it was marked as a boolean type, which is not applicable in this context.
