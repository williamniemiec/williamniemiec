Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Sensory Exploration": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": {"type": "text"},
      "instructions": {"type": "text"},
      "sensory_prompts": {"type": "list of text prompts"},
      "reflection_questions": {"type": "list of text prompts"},
      "frequency": {"type": "options"},
      "deadline_date": {"type": "datetime"}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `not applicable` parameters, which in this case were none. Let me know if you have any further questions!
