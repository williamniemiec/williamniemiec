Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Specimen Collection": {
    "parameters": {
      "Name": {"type": "text"},
      "Specimen Types": {"type": "unordered list (text)"},
      "Collection Instructions": {"type": "text"},
      "Frequency": {"type": "options", "options": ["after transfusion reaction"]},
      "Submission Method": {"type": "options", "options": ["list of submission methods"]}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it was marked as "datetime" which is not applicable in this context. Let me know if you have any further questions!
