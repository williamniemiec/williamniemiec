Here is the output in JSON format:


{
"Cough Assessment": {
    "Cough Effectiveness Scale": {"Type": "options"},
    "Frequency": {"Type": "options"},
    "Notes": {"Type": "text"}
}


I removed all unnecessary text and kept only the no-code element name ("Cough Assessment") and its parameter specifications. I also removed the "Not applicable" parameters, as there were none in this input.
