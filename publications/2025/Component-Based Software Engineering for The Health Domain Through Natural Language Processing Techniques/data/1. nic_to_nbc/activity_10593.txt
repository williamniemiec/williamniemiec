Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Viewing Arrangement": {
    "Task Title": {},
    "Task Description": {},
    "Family Contact Information": {},
    "Viewing Details": {},
    "Support Options": {},
    "Task Frequency": {},
    "Deadline Date": {}
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Content Type` parameter as it's not a part of the `PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS`. Also, I didn't include the `Description` and `Required` fields for each parameter as they are not requested in the output. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
