Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Sexual Protection Considerations": {
    "Religious Considerations": {},
    "Cultural Considerations": {},
    "Developmental Considerations": {},
    "Socioeconomical Considerations": {},
    "Individual Considerations": {},
    "Resources": {},
    "Frequency": {},
    "Deadline Date": {}
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Type` and `Required` fields, as well as the descriptions and other unnecessary information. Let me know if you'd like me to keep any of those fields!
