Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Radiation Protection Protocol": {
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "name", "description": "title of the radiation protection protocol"},
      {"name": "content", "description": "detailed information and guidelines on radiation protection"},
      {"name": "format", "description": "format of the information"},
      {"name": "frequency", "description": "how often to review the information"}
    ]
  }
}


I removed `deadline_date` as it was marked as not applicable (`required: false`). Let me know if you need any further modifications!
