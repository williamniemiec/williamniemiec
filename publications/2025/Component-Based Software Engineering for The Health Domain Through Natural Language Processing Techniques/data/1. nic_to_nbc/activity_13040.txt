Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Drainage Device": {
    "Indication": {"Description": "Reason for installing a drainage device (e.g. wound type, fluid accumulation)", "Required": true, "Type": "text"},
    "Device Type": {"Description": "Type of drainage device to use (e.g. Jackson-Pratt, Hemovac)", "Required": true, "Type": "options", "Options": [{"value": "Jackson-Pratt", "label": "Jackson-Pratt"}, {"value": "Hemovac", "label": "Hemovac"}, {"value": "other", "label": "Other (please specify)"}]},
    "Instructions": {"Description": "Instructions on how to install and use the drainage device", "Required": true, "Type": "text"},
    "Emptying Frequency": {"Description": "How often to empty the drainage device", "Required": true, "Type": "options", "Options": [{"value": "daily", "label": "Daily"}, {"value": "everyOtherDay", "label": "Every other day"}, {"value": "every2Days", "label": "Every 2 days"}, {"value": "every3Days", "label": "Every 3 days"}]}
  }
}


Note that I removed the "Duration" parameter since it was marked as not required. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
