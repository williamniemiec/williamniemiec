Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Guide": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "",
      "pages": ""
    }
  },
  "Drainage Schedule": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "",
      "schedule": "",
      "reminders": ""
    }
  },
  "Drainage Tracker": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "",
      "entries": "",
      "tags": ""
    }
  },
  "Tutorial": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "",
      "steps": "",
      "tips": ""
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the introduction and conclusion, as well as the numbering and descriptions of the no-code elements. I also removed any parameters that were not applicable (i.e., empty or "not applicable" values). The remaining output is a JSON object with each no-code element as a key, and its corresponding parameters as values.
