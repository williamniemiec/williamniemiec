Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Care Planner": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Cue-Based Care": {
        "Description": "interactive planner to help parents plan care based on infant cues, such as hunger or tiredness",
        "Required": true,
        "Type": "interactive form"
      },
      "State-Based Care": {
        "Description": "interactive planner to help parents plan care based on infant states, such as awake or asleep",
        "Required": true,
        "Type": "interactive form"
      },
      "Care Options": {
        "Description": "list of care options, such as feeding or changing, that parents can choose from based on infant cues and states",
        "Required": true,
        "Type": "list of text and images"
      }
    }
  }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters (`Care Schedule` and `Tips and Reminders`) since they are marked as `Required: false`. Let me know if this is what you were expecting!
