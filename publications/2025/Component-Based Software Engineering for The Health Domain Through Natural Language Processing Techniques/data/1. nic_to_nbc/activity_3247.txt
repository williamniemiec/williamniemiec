Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Symptom Reporter": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Symptoms": {},
      "Description": {},
      "Frequency": {},
      "Reporting Method": {}
    }
  }
}


I removed all unnecessary information and kept only the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the "Deadline Date" parameter since it's not applicable in this context. Let me know if you have any further questions!
