Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Message": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "Emotional Support Message",
      "content": "A brief message of support and understanding, e.g. \"We understand that this can be a difficult time for you and your family. Please know that we are here to support you and provide any guidance we can.\"",
      "frequency": "As needed, or at specific milestones (e.g. when the graft is determined not to have taken)"
    }
  },
  "Task": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "Emotional Support Task",
      "content": "A brief description of the task, e.g. \"Please reach out to our counseling services or a support group to talk to someone about your feelings and concerns.\"",
      "frequency": "As needed, or at specific milestones (e.g. when the graft is determined not to have taken)"
    }
  }
}


I removed all unnecessary text and kept only the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the `deadline_date` parameter since it was marked as "Not applicable" in both cases. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
