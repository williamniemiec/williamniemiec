Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Fluid Intake Tracker": {
    "name": "Fluid Intake",
    "unit": "",
    "goal": "",
    "frequency": ""
  },
  "Education Module": {
    "name": "Hyponatremia Education",
    "content": "",
    "format": ""
  }
}


Note that I removed the parameters that were not applicable (e.g. `deadline_date` in "Fluid Intake Tracker" and kept only the relevant ones). Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
