Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Attachment Risk Assessment": {
    "Risk Factors": [
      {
        "Risk Factor Name": "",
        "Questions": [
          {
            "Question Text": "",
            "Answer Type": "",
            "Options": [
              {
                "Label": "",
                "Value": ""
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Scoring": {
      "Scoring Method": "",
      "Scoring Scale": []
    },
    "Results": {
      "Summary": "",
      "Recommendations": []
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the "Content Type" parameter as it was not applicable to the no-code element. Also, I didn't include the "Description" and other non-parameter elements in the output.
