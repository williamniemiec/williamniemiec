Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Posture and Body Mechanics Instruction": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {"Type": "text"},
      "Activity Types": {"Type": "unordered list"},
      "Posture Instructions": {"Type": "ordered list"},
      "Body Mechanics Instructions": {"Type": "ordered list"},
      "Tips and Reminders": {"Type": "unordered list"}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Images or Videos` parameter as it was not applicable. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
