Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Ambulation Goal Setter": {
    "Current Distance": {"type": "text"},
    "Target Distance": {"type": "text"},
    "Increment": {"type": "text"},
    "Frequency": {"type": "options"},
    "Deadline Date": {"type": "datetime"}
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Motivational Message` parameter as it was filled with a large number of exclamation marks, indicating that it might not be applicable.
