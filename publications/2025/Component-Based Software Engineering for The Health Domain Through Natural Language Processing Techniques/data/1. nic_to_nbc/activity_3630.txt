Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "IV Fluid Administration": {
    "Fluid Type": {},
    "Volume": {},
    "Rate": {},
    "Temperature": {}
  }
}


I removed all non-parameter specifications and only kept the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed any parameters that were not applicable (i.e., had `Required`: false). Let me know if this meets your requirements!
