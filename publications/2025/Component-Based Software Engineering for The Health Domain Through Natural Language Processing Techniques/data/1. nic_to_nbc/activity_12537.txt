Here is the output in JSON format:

{
  "Interest Explorer": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Interest Categories": {"Type": "options"},
      "Discovery Questions": {"Type": "text or multiple-choice options"},
      "Interest Matching": {"Type": "internal algorithm"},
      "Resource Library": {"Type": "internal feature or integration with existing platforms"},
      "Frequency": {"Type": "options"},
    }
  }
}

I removed all the unnecessary text and only kept the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` which is `"Interest Explorer"` and the `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the not applicable parameters. Let me know if this is what you were expecting!
