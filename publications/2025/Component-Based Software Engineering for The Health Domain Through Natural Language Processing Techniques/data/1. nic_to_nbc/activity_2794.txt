Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Stress Management Guide": {
    "title of the guide": {"type": "text", "required": true},
    "Techniques": {"type": "unordered list", "required": true, "options": ["Deep breathing exercises", "Progressive muscle relaxation", "Meditation", "Yoga", "Journaling", "Other"]},
    "Instructions": {"type": "book-page", "required": true, "book-page": "list of HTML texts"},
    "Frequency": {"type": "options", "required": true, "options": ["Daily", "Every other day", "3 times a week", "Weekly", "As needed"]}
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it was marked as not required. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
