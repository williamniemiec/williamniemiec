Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Behavioral Monitoring": {
        "Parameters": {
            "Behavior Type": [],
            "Frequency": [],
            "Duration": [],
            "Intensity": [],
            "Notes": []
        }
    }
}


Note that I removed the "Not Applicable" parameters as per your request. Also, I didn't include any values for the parameters as they were not specified in the input text.
