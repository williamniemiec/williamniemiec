Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Care Team": {
    "Members": {"type": "list of healthcare provider profiles"},
    "Roles": {"type": "list of role descriptions"},
    "Communication": {"type": "options"},
    "Goals": {"type": "list of goal descriptions"},
    "Progress": {"type": "options"}
  }
}


Note that I removed the not applicable parameters, which are `Care Plan` and `Task Assignment`, as they were mentioned as advanced features but not part of the main parameter specifications.
