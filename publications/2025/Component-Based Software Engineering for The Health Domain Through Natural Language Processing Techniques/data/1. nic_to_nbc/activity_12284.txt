Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Symptom Monitoring": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": {},
      "description": {},
      "symptoms": {},
      "frequency": {},
      "reporting": {}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the `resources` parameter as it's not applicable in this context, and also didn't include any specific values for the parameters as they were not provided in the input text.
