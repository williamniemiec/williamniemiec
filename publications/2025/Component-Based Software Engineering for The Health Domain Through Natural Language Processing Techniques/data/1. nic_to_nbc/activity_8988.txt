Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Foot Support": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {},
      "Footboard Type": {},
      "Footboard Instructions": {},
      "Foot Positioning": {}
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it's not applicable to the no-code element. Let me know if you have any further questions!
