Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "name": "Diaper Output Tracking",
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "Diaper Output Method"
    },
    {
      "name": "Diaper Count Goal"
    },
    {
      "name": "Diaper Weight Goal"
    },
    {
      "name": "Tracking Frequency"
    },
    {
      "name": "Reminders"
    }
  ]
}


I removed the non-applicable parameters (Additional Resources) and kept only the names of the no-code element and its parameters. Let me know if this is what you were expecting!
