Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Procedure Guide": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Procedure Name": {
        "Description": "Name of the new procedure",
        "Required": true,
        "Type": "text"
      },
      "Step-by-Step Instructions": {
        "Description": "List of step-by-step instructions for the new procedure",
        "Required": true,
        "Type": "list-item",
        "List-item": "list of instruction objects, each with a title, description, and image/video"
      }
    }
  }
}


I removed the "Tips and Reminders" parameter because it's not required. Let me know if you need anything else!
