Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Car Seat Instruction": {
    "instruction title": {},
    "Car Seat Type": {},
    "Installation Instructions": {},
    "Manufacturer's Recommendations": {},
    "Frequency": {}
  }
}


I removed all non-applicable parameters, including `Deadline Date` since it was marked as not required. Let me know if you have any further questions!
