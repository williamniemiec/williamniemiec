Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Foot History": {
    "Changes in Feet": {"Type": "text"},
    "History of Foot Ulcers": {"Type": "options", "Options": ["yes", "no"]},
    "History of Amputation": {"Type": "options", "Options": ["yes", "no"]},
    "Details": {"Type": "text"},
    "Frequency": {"Type": "options", "Options": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"]}
  }
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it was marked as "datetime" which is not applicable.
