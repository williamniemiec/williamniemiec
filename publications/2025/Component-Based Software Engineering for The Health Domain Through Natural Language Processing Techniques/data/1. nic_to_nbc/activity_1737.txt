Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Outcome Negotiation": {
    "parameters": [
      {"Issue": {"type": "text"}},
      {"Possible Outcomes": {"type": "list of text"}},
      {"Evaluation Criteria": {"type": "list of text"}},
      {"Negotiation Technique": {"type": "options", "options": ["compromise", "trade-off", "prioritization"]}},
      {"Frequency": {"type": "options", "options": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"]}}
    ]
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it was marked as not required (`"required": false`). Let me know if you'd like me to include it anyway!
