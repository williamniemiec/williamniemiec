Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Question": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "",
      "answer type": "",
      "options": ""
    }
  },
  "Open-Ended Question": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "",
      "answer type": "text"
    }
  },
  "Rating Scale": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "",
      "answer type": "rating scale"
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the not applicable parameters and only kept the `name` parameter as it was present in all elements, even if it didn't have a specific value. If you want to remove it as well, just let me know!
