Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Caregiver Role Reinforcement": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {"Type": "text"},
      "Affirmations": {"Type": "list of text", "Examples": ["You are doing a great job as a caregiver!", "Remember, you are not alone in this journey."]},
      "Encouragement": {"Type": "list of text", "Examples": ["Keep going, you're making a difference!", "Your hard work is paying off!"]},
      "Frequency": {"Type": "options", "Options": ["daily", "every other day", "weekly", "etc."]},
      "Customization": {"Type": "boolean", "Options": [true, false]}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Reflection Prompts` and `Goal Setting` parameters as they were marked as "Interactive Elements" which are not part of the original parameter specifications.
