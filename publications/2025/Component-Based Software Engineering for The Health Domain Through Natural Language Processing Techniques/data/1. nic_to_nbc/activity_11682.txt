  "Alert Device": {
    "name": {"type": "text"},
    "content": {"type": "text"},
    "device_type": {"type": "options", "options": ["bracelet", "necklace"]},
    "device_info": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "device_name": {},
        "device_description": {},
        "device_image": {}
      }
    },
    "reminder": {"type": "boolean"}

}
