Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "name": "instruction",
    "parameters": [
        { 
            "name": "title", 
            "description": "instruction title"
        },
        { 
            "name": "content", 
            "description": "instruction content"
        },
        { 
            "name": "rationale", 
            "description": "rationale for removing dentures"
        },
        { 
            "name": "frequency", 
            "description": "how often to wear dentures",
            "options": [
                { value: "onlyMeals", label: "Only for meals" }
            ]
        }
    ]
}


Note that I removed the `required` and `type` fields as they were not specified in the problem statement. If you need those fields, let me know!
