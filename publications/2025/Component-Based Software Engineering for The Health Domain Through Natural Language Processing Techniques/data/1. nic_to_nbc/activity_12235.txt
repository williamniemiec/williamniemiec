Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Respiratory Exercise": {
        "parameters": [
            {"Name": {"type": "text"}},
            {"Description": {"type": "text"}},
            {"Exercises": {"type": "checklist", "options": ["coughing", "deep breathing", "turning"]}},
            {"Frequency": {"type": "options", "options": ["every 2 hours", "every 4 hours"]}}
        ]
    }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it was marked as not applicable (`required: false`). Let me know if you have any further questions!
