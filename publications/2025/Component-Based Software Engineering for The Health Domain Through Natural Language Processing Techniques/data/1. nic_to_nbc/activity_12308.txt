Since there is no `PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS` section in the input text, I will assume it is not applicable.

As for the `NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME`, it can be inferred from the last paragraph of the text. Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME": "store and organize the patient's artwork in a digital file or portfolio"
}
