Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Acupressure Log": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {},
      "Description": {},
      "Response": {},
      "Frequency": {},
      "Deadline Date": {}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the "Photo" parameter as it is marked as optional and not applicable. Let me know if you need anything else!
