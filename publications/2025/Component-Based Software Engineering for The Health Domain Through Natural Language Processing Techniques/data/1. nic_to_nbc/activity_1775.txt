Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "name": "Communication Assessment",
    "parameters": [
        { 
            "name": "Cue Type"
        },
        { 
            "name": "Cue Description"
        },
        { 
            "name": "Assessment Method"
        },
        { 
            "name": "Frequency"
        },
        { 
            "name": "Deadline Date"
        }
    ]
}


I removed all unnecessary information and only kept the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the `not applicable` parameters. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
