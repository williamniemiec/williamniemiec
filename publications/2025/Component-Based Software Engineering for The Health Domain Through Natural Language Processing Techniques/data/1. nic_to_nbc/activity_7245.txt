Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Vegetable Guide": {
        "Parameters": {
            "Vegetable List": {"Type": "list of text or images"},
            "Preparation Tips": {"Type": "list of text or HTML"},
            "Serving Suggestions": {"Type": "list of text or HTML"},
            "Benefits Information": {"Type": "text or HTML"}
        }
    }
}


Note that I removed the "Frequency" parameter as it's marked as "options" which is not applicable in this context.
