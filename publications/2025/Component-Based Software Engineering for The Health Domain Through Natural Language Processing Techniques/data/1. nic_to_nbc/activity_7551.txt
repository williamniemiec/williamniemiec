Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Question": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "Family Participation",
      "question": "Who would you like to have present during the birth process?",
      "answer type": "options (e.g., partner, family member, friend) or text",
      "frequency": "once (or as needed)"
    }
  },
  "Form": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "Family Participation",
      "fields": [
        "Who would you like to have present during the birth process?",
        "What role would you like them to play?",
        "Are there any specific cultural or religious practices you would like to incorporate?"
      ],
      "frequency": "once (or as needed)"
    }
  }
}


I removed all unnecessary text and kept only the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the "not applicable" parameters. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
