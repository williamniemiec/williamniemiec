Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Environmental Control": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {"Type": "text"},
      "Stimuli": {"Type": "list of stimuli types"},
      "Tips": {"Type": "list of tips and suggestions"},
      "Frequency": {"Type": "options (e.g. daily, weekly, as needed)"},
      "Reminders": {"Type": "options (e.g. daily, weekly, custom)"}
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it's not applicable in this context. Let me know if you have any further requests!
