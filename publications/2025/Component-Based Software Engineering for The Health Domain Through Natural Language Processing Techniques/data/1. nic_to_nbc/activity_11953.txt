Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Hand Washing": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Hand Washing Title": {
        "Description": "Title of the hand washing reminder",
        "Required": true,
        "Type": "text"
      },
      "Instructions": {
        "Description": "Provide instructions on how to properly wash hands",
        "Required": true,
        "Type": "text"
      },
      "Frequency": {
        "Description": "Specify how often the patient should wash hands after petting or contacting an animal",
        "Required": true,
        "Type": "options",
        "Options": ["afterEachContact", "atLeastOnceADay", "etc."]
      }
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the not applicable parameters ("Reminders" and "Deadline Date") as they are marked as `false` in the Required field.
