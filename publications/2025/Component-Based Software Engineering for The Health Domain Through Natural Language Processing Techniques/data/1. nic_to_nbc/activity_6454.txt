Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Medication Restriction": {
        "parameters": {
            "name": "Medication name (in this case, Aspirin)",
            "description": "Brief description of the medication restriction",
            "reason": "Reason for the restriction (in this case, \"not recommended for children\")",
            "age_restriction": "Age range for which the medication is restricted (in this case, \"children\")"
        }
    }
}


Note: I removed the `alternative` parameter as it was marked as optional. If you want to include it, just let me know!
