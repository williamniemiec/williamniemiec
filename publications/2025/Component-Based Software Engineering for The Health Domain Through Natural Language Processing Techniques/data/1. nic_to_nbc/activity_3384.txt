Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "foot care survey": {
        "parameters": [
            {"name": "frequency", "description": "how often do you perform foot care"},
            {"name": "methods", "description": "what methods do you use for foot care"},
            {"name": "challenges", "description": "what challenges do you face with foot care"}
        ]
    }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters and kept only the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}` as requested. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
