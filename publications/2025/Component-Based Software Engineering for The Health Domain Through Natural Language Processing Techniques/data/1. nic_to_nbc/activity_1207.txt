Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Comfort Support": {
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "Comfort Options", "type": "options"},
      {"name": "Instructions", "type": "text"},
      {"name": "Videos/Demonstrations", "type": "media"},
      {"name": "Tips", "type": "text"}
    ]
  }
}


I removed the `Reminders` parameter because it was marked as not applicable (`required: false`). Let me know if this is correct!
