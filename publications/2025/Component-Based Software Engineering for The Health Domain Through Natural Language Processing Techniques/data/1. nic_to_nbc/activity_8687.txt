Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "name": "Reinforcer Selection",
    "parameters": [
        {
            "name": "Reinforcer Options"
        },
        {
            "name": "Selection Type"
        },
        {
            "name": "Significance Criteria"
        },
        {
            "name": "Frequency"
        }
    ]
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it is not applicable (i.e., its `required` field is set to `false`). Let me know if you have any further questions!
