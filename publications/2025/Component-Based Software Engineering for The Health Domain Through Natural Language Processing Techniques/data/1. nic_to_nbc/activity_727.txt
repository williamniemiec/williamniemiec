Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Autonomy Building Exercise": {
        "Exercise Type": {"type": "options", "options": ["decision-making", "problem-solving", "goal-setting", "etc."]},
        "Exercise Instructions": {"type": "text"},
        "Autonomy Level": {"type": "options", "options": ["independent", "guided", "assisted"]},
        "Feedback Mechanism": {"type": "options", "options": ["self-assessment", "peer review", "healthcare provider feedback"]},
        "Frequency": {"type": "options", "options": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"]},
        "Deadline Date": {"type": "datetime"}
    }
}


I removed the introduction, number, and conclusion sections, as well as the not applicable parameters. The remaining parameters are organized under the "Autonomy Building Exercise" element, with each parameter having its own object with "type" and "options" (if applicable) properties.
