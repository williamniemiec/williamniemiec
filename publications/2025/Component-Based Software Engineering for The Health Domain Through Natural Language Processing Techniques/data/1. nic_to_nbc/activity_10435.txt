Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Explore Dark": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {},
      "Instructions": {},
      "Frequency": {},
      "Deadline Date": {}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Reflection` parameter as it was not applicable (i.e., it didn't have a specific value or option). Let me know if you need any further assistance!
