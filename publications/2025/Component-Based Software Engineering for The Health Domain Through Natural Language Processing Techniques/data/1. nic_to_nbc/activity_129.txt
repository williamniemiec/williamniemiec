Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "name": "medical clearance",
    "parameters": [
        { 
            "name": "activity", 
            "description": "specify the activity that requires medical clearance"
        },
        { 
            "name": "reason", 
            "description": "explain why medical clearance is required"
        },
        { 
            "name": "deadline_date", 
            "description": "specify the due date for obtaining medical clearance"
        },
        { 
            "name": "upload_document", 
            "description": "upload the medical clearance document"
        }
    ]
}


I removed all unnecessary information and kept only the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the `required` and `type` fields from the parameters as they were not specified to be included in the output.
