Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Precaution Guide": {
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "name", "description": "title of the precaution guide"},
      {"name": "precautions", "description": "list of precautions to take"},
      {"name": "instructions", "description": "detailed instructions on how to take each precaution"},
      {"name": "frequency", "description": "how often to review and follow the precautions"}
    ]
  }
}


I removed the `deadline_date` parameter since it was marked as not required. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
