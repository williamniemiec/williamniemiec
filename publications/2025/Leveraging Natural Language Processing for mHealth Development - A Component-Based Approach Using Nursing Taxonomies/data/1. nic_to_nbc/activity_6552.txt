Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Extremity Protection": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Extremity": {"Type": "options"},
      "Protection methods": {"Type": "options"},
      "Additional instructions": {"Type": "text"},
      "Deadline date": {"Type": "datetime"}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the "Reminders" parameter as it was marked as a boolean type, which is not applicable in this context.
