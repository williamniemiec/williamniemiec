Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Tummy Time Exercise": {
    "Exercise Name": {"type": "text", "required": true},
    "Step-by-Step Instructions": {"type": "illustrated guide", "required": true},
    "Frequency and Duration": {"type": "text", "required": true}
  }
}


I removed the non-applicable parameters (i.e., those with `Required: false`) and kept only the required parameters, along with their types. Let me know if this meets your requirements!
