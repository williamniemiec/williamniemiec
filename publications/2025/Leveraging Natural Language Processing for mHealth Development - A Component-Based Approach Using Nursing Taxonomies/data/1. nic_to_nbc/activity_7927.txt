Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Ambulation": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Type": {"Type": "options"},
      "Frequency": {"Type": "options"},
      "Duration": {"Type": "text"},
      "Distance": {"Type": "text"},
      "Assistance": {"Type": "options"},
      "Instructions": {"Type": "text"}
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Video/Demonstration` parameter as it's not applicable since its type is ambiguous (video or image). Let me know if you have any further questions!
