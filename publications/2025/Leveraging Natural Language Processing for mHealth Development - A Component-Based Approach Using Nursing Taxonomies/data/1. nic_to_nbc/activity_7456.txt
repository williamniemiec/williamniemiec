Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Incision Site Care Instruction": {
    "parameters": {
      "Incision Site Care Title": {},
      "Incision Site": {},
      "Care Instructions": {},
      "Frequency": {},
      "Deadline Date": {}
    }
  }
}


I removed all unnecessary information and only kept the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the not applicable parameters, which are the ones with `Required: false`. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
