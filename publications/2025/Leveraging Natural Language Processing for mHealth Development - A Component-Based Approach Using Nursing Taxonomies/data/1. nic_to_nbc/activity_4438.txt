Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Suction Connection": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {},
      "Indications": {},
      "Connection Instructions": {},
      "Suction Settings": {},
      "Monitoring": {}
    }
  }
}


I removed the "Alerts and Notifications" parameter as it was a boolean type, which is not applicable in this context. Let me know if you have any further questions!
