Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Deepening Technique Explorer": {
    "Technique List": {"type": "list of options"},
    "Description": {"type": "text"},
    "Rating": {"type": "rating scale"},
    "Notes": {"type": "text"},
    "Favorite": {"type": "boolean"}
  }
}


I removed the `Step-by-Step Guide` parameter as it was marked as not applicable (it can be either text or multimedia, which is unclear). Let me know if you need any further assistance!
