Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Support System Guidance": {
    "parameters": {
      "Guidance Content": {"type": "list of multimedia resources"},
      "Support System Types": {"type": "list of text"},
      "Development Strategies": {"type": "list of text"},
      "Maintenance Tips": {"type": "list of text"},
      "Reflection Prompts": {"type": "list of text"},
      "Frequency": {"type": "options"},
      "Deadline Date": {"type": "datetime"}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Introduction` and `Conclusion` sections, as well as the `NUMBER` element, and only kept the `PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS` section. I also reformatted the output to be in JSON format. Let me know if you have any further requests!
