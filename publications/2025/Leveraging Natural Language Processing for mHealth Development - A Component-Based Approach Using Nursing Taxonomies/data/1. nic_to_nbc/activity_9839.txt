Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Interest Finder": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Interest Categories": {},
      "Goal Setting": {},
      "Matching Algorithm": {},
      "Connection Platform": {},
      "Frequency": {}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it's not applicable in this case, and also removed any descriptions or other text that wasn't part of the `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}` section. Let me know if you have any further questions!
