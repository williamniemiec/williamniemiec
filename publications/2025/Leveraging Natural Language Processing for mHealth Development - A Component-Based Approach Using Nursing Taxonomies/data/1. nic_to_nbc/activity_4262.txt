Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Exercise Tutorial": {
    "tutorial title": {},
    "leg exercises": {},
    "steps": [
      {"Step 1: Preparation": {}},
      {"Step 2: Execution": {}},
      {"Step 3: Safety Precautions": {}}
    ],
    "frequency": {},
    "deadline date": {}
  }
}


Note that I removed the not applicable parameters (i.e., those with Required: false) and only kept the parameter names and their corresponding values. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
