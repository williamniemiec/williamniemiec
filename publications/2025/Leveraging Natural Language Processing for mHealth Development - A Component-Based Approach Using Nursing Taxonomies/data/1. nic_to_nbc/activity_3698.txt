Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Computer System Orientation": {
    "Tutorial Steps": {
      "Description": "List of steps to orient patients to the computer system",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "list-item",
      "List-item": "list of tutorial step objects, each with a title, description, and screenshot/image"
    }
  }
}


I removed all unnecessary text and kept only the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` ("Computer System Orientation") and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}` (the parameters "Tutorial Steps" with its details). I also removed the not applicable parameter "Interactive Elements" since it's not required.
