Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Practice Session": {
    "session_name": {},
    "instructions_text": {},
    "exercise": {},
    "spacing": {},
    "frequency": {}
  }
}


I removed all unnecessary information and only kept the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it's marked as not required. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
