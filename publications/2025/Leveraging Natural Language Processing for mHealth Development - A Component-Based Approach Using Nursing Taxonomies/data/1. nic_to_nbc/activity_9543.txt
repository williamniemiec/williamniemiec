Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Balance Assessor": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Balance Activities": {
        "Type": "list of text options"
      },
      "Assessment Questions": {
        "Type": "list of text questions"
      },
      "Scoring System": {
        "Type": "text"
      },
      "Frequency": {
        "Type": "options"
      }
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Deadline Date` and `Results Tracking` parameters as they were marked as `- Type:` which seemed like a notation for non-applicable parameters. If that's not the case, let me know and I'll add them back in.
