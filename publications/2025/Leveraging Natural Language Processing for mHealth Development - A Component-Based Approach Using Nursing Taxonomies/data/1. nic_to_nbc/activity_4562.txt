Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Medication Administration Documentation": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Medication Administration Form": {},
      "Patient Responsiveness Assessment": {},
      "Agency Protocol": {},
      "Frequency": {},
      "Deadline Date": {}
    }
  }
}


I removed the "Electronic Signature" parameter as it's not applicable in this context. Let me know if you need further assistance!
