Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Assistance Request": {
    "Name": {},
    "Description": {},
    "Frequency": {"type": "options", "options": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"]},
    "Deadline Date": {"type": "datetime"},
    "Request Type": {"type": "options", "options": ["dressing", "undressing", "other"]}
  }
}


Note that I removed the parameters that are not applicable (i.e. no type or options specified) and kept only the relevant information. Let me know if this is what you were expecting!
