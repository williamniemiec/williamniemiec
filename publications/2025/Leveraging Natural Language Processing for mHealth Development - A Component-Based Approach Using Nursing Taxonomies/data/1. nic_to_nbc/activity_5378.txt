Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Care Team Coordinator": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "care team coordinator name",
      "description": "brief description of the care team coordinator",
      "team_members": [
        {
          "name": "name of the team member",
          "role": "role of the team member",
          "contact_info": "contact information for the team member"
        }
      ],
      "task_list": "list of tasks and activities to be coordinated among team members"
    }
  }
}


I removed all unnecessary text and only kept the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the optional parameters that were marked as "not applicable" (i.e., `scheduling_tool` and `communication_channel`).
