Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "stroking_guide": {
        "parameters": [
            {"name": "title", "description": "guide title"},
            {"name": "video_url", "description": "url of the video illustrating the stroking technique"},
            {"name": "description", "description": "step-by-step instructions on how to gently stroke infant in prone upright position"}
        ]
    }
}


Note that I removed the "tips" parameter since it's not required. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
