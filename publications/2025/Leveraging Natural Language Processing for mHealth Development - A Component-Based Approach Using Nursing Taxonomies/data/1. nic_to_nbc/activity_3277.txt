Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Vital Signs Tracking": {
    "Blood Pressure Value": {"type": "number"},
    "Heart Rate Value": {"type": "number"},
    "Respiratory Status": {"type": "text"},
    "Frequency": {"type": "options", "options": ["daily", "weekly", "monthly"]},
    "Target Range": {"type": "range"}
  }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters and kept only the necessary information. Let me know if this is what you were expecting!
