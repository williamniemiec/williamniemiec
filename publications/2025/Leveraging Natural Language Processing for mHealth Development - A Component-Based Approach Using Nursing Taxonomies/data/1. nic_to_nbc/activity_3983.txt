Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Stimulation Method Selection": {
        "parameters": {
            "name": "",
            "methods": []
        }
    },
    "Duration and Frequency Selection": {
        "parameters": {
            "name": "",
            "durations": [],
            "frequencies": [],
            "method": ""
        }
    },
    "Recommendation": {
        "parameters": {
            "name": "",
            "recommended_duration": "",
            "recommended_frequency": "",
            "explanation": ""
        }
    },
    "Schedule": {
        "parameters": {
            "name": "",
            "reminder_time": "",
            "duration": "",
            "frequency": ""
        }
    }
}


Note that I removed the `INTRODUCTION` and `CONCLUSION` sections, as well as the numbers and descriptions of the no-code elements. I only kept the `NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME`s and their corresponding `PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS`. I also removed any parameters that were marked as "not applicable" (none in this case).
