Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Food Presentation Guide": {
    "parameters": {
      "Food Presentation Tips": {"type": "text"},
      "Temperature Control": {"type": "range"},
      "Frequency": {"options": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"]},
      "Deadline Date": {"type": "datetime"}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Introduction` and `Conclusion` sections, as well as the `NUMBER` and `NO-CODE ELEMENT DESCRIPTION` parts. I also removed the `**Task** element` and `**Guide** element` references since they are not part of the `PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS`. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
