Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Bleeding Risk Tracker": {
    "parameters": {
      "Bleeding Episodes": {},
      "Bleeding Risk Factors": {},
      "Vital Signs": {},
      "Bruising or Petechiae": {},
      "Frequency": {},
      "Deadline Date": {}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Additional Notes` parameter as it is not applicable (it's a free-text field, not a specific parameter). Let me know if you have any further questions!
