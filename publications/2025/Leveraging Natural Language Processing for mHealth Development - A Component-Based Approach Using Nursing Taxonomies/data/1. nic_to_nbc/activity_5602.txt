Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Comfort Scale": {
        "parameters": {
            "Question": "",
            "Scale": ["Likert scale", "Visual analog scale"],
            "Options": ["Not comfortable at all", "Somewhat comfortable", "Neutral", "Somewhat uncomfortable", "Very uncomfortable"],
            "Frequency": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"],
            "Deadline Date": {"type": "datetime"}
        }
    },
    "Survey": {
        "parameters": {
            "Questions": [],
            "Answer type": ["Text", "Select", "Boolean"],
            "Frequency": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"],
            "Deadline Date": {"type": "datetime"}
        }
    }
}


Note that I removed the "Introduction" and "Conclusion" sections, as well as the element descriptions. I also removed the "Not Applicable" parameters, as there were none in this specific input. Let me know if you have any further questions!
