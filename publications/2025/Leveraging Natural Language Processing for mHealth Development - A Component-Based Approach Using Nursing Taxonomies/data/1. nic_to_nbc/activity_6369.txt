Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Medication Profile Review": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Medications": {
        "Type": "unordered list"
      },
      "Side Effects": {
        "Type": "unordered list"
      },
      "Frequency": {
        "Options": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"]
      },
      "Deadline Date": {
        "Type": "datetime"
      },
      "Notes": {
        "Type": "text"
      }
    }
  }
}


I removed the introduction and conclusion, as well as the alternative no-code elements ("Medication List", "Side Effect Review", "Frequency and Deadline"). I only kept the original no-code element name ("Medication Profile Review") and its parameters. Let me know if this is what you were expecting!
