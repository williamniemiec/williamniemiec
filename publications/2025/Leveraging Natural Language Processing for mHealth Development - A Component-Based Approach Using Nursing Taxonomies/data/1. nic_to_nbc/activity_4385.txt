Here is the output in JSON format:

{
  "Outdoor Safety Guide": {
    "title": {},
    "importance_of_supervision": {},
    "safety_tips": {},
    "outdoor_activities": {},
    "frequency": {}
  }
}

I removed all non-parameter specifications and only kept the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the `"deadline_date"` parameter since it's marked as not required. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
