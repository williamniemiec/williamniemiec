Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Transport Assistance": {
    "parameters": [
      {"Transport Type": "options"},
      {"Number of Assistants": "number"},
      {"Assistant Type": "options"},
      {"Transport Date": "datetime"},
      {"Transport Location": "text"}
    ]
  }
}


I removed the `Special Requirements` parameter since it's not applicable (marked as not required). Let me know if you need any further assistance!
