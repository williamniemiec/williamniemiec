Here is the output in JSON format:

{
  "Vehicular Injury Risk Assessment": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Demographics": {},
      "Driving Habits": {},
      "Medical Conditions": {},
      "Medications": {},
      "Risk Level": {},
      "Personalized Recommendations": {},
      "Frequency": {}
    }
  }
}

Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it is not applicable (datetime type). Let me know if you need further assistance!
