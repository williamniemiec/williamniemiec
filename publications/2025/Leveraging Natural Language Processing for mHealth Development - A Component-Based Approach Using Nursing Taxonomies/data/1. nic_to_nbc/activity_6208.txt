Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "name": "Describe Experiences with Five Senses",
    "parameters": [
        { 
            "name": "Sense Selection", 
            "type": "checklist"
        },
        { 
            "name": "Experience Description", 
            "type": "text"
        },
        { 
            "name": "Frequency", 
            "type": "options"
        }
    ]
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it was marked as optional in the original text. Let me know if you'd like me to include it anyway!
