Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Health Tip": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": "Avoid Smoking and Alcohol",
      "Content": "Avoid smoking and alcohol use to improve your health",
      "Type": "text",
      "Frequency": "options (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly)"
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it was marked as "not applicable". Let me know if you have any further questions!
