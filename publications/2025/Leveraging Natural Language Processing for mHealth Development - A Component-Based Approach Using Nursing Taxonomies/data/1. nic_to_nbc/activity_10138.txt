Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Supportive Touch": {
    "Touch Area": {"Type": "options"},
    "Touch Type": {"Type": "options"},
    "Frequency": {"Options": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"]},
    "Duration": {"Type": "time interval"}
  }
}


Note that I removed the "Guided Audio" parameter since it was marked as optional and did not have a specific value specified.
