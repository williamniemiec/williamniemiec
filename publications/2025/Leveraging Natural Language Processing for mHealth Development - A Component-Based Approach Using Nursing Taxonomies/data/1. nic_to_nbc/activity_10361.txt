Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Hypoglycemia Education": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Title": {"Description": "Title of the hypoglycemia education guide", "Required": true, "Type": "text"},
      "Sections": {"Description": "List of sections in the guide (e.g. signs and symptoms, risk factors, treatment)", "Required": true, "Type": "unordered list"},
      "Content": {"Description": "Content of the guide, including text, images, and videos", "Required": true, "Type": "rich text"}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Quiz` and `Resources` parameters since they are not required. Let me know if you have any further questions!
