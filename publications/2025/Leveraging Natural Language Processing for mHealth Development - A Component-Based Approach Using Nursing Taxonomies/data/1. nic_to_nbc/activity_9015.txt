Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Aerosol Treatment": {
    "Treatment name": {
      "Description": "Name of the aerosol treatment",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "Text"
    },
    "Why": {
      "Description": "Explanation of why the treatment is being administered",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "Text"
    },
    "Dosage": {
      "Description": "Dosage instructions for the patient",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "Text"
    },
    "Frequency": {
      "Description": "How often the patient should receive the treatment",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "Options",
      "Options": [
        { "value": "daily", "label": "Daily" },
        { "value": "onlyOnce", "label": "Only once" },
        { "value": "everyHours", "label": "Every x hours" },
        { "value": "everyDays", "label": "Every x days" }
      ]
    }
  }
}


I removed the parameters that were marked as "Not Applicable" (i.e. `Notes` and `Deadline date`) from the output. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
