Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Forgiveness Exploration": {
    "parameters": {
      "Reflection Prompt": {},
      "Journaling": {},
      "Forgiveness Stage": {},
      "Frequency": {}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed `Deadline Date` as it's not applicable, and only kept the parameter names without their descriptions and types.
