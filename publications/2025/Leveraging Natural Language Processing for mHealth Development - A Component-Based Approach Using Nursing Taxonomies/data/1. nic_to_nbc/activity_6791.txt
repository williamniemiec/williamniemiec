Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Vehicle Safety Guide": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {"Type": "text"},
      "Description": {"Type": "text"},
      "Safe Driving Tips": {"Type": "list", "Items": []},
      "Vehicle Maintenance": {"Type": "list", "Items": []},
      "Road Safety Resources": {"Type": "list", "Items": []}
    }
  }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters ("Goal Setting" and "Reminders") as they are boolean types and don't have any additional information. Let me know if you need anything else!
