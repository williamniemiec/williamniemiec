Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Educational Resource": {
    "resource_name": {},
    "content_text": {},
    "format": {},
    "frequency": {}
  }
}


I removed all unnecessary elements and only kept the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` ("Educational Resource") and the applicable parameters from `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. The optional parameter `"Diagrams"` was not included as it's not required, and `"Deadline Date"` was also excluded as it's not required.
