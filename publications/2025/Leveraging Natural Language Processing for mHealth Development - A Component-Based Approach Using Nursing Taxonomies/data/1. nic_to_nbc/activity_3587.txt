Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Contraindication Guide": {
        "Pessary Type": {"type": "options", "options": [{"value": "ring", "label": "Ring"}, {"value": "dish", "label": "Dish"}, {"value": "cube", "label": "Cube"}]},
        "Contraindications": {"type": "unordered list"},
        "Intercourse": {"type": "boolean"},
        "Douching": {"type": "boolean"}
    }
}


Note that I removed the `Additional Info` parameter since it was marked as not required. Let me know if you have any further questions!
