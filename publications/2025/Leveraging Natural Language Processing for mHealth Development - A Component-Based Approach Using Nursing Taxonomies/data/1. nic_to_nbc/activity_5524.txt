Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Parenting Harmony": {
    "Current Parenting Style": "text",
    "Comparison to Other Children": "text",
    "Goal Setting": "text or checklist",
    "Technique Library": "list of options or links to resources",
    "Reflection and Feedback": "journal or log"
  }
}


Note that I removed the "Reminders and Notifications" parameter since its type is boolean (yes/no) or frequency, which can be considered as not applicable parameters.
