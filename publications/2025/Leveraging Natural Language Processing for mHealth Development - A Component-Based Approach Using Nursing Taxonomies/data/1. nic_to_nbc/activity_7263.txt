Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "name": "journal entry",
    "parameters": [
        {
            "name": "prompt",
            "type": "text"
        },
        {
            "name": "answer type",
            "type": "options"
        },
        {
            "name": "frequency",
            "type": "options"
        },
        {
            "name": "deadline_date",
            "type": "datetime"
        }
    ]
}

Note: I removed the `description` field as it was not specified in the problem statement. Also, I removed the `required` field and `options` array for brevity. Let me know if you need them included.
