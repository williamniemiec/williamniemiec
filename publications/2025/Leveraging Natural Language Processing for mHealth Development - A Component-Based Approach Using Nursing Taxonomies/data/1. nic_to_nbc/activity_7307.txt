Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Calm Response": {
    "Response Template": {"Description": "A template for caregivers or family members to respond to misperceptions", "Required": true, "Type": "text"},
    "Tone Guidance": {"Description": "Guidance on maintaining a calm, reassuring, and nonargumentative tone", "Required": true, "Type": "text"}
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Example Responses` parameter since it's not required. Let me know if you need anything else!
