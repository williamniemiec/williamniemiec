Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Decision-Making Guide": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {},
      "Description": {},
      "Decision-Making Strategies": {},
      "Goal Setting": {},
      "Reflection Questions": {},
      "Resources": {}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Reminders` parameter as it was marked as a boolean type, which is not applicable in this context. Let me know if you have any further questions!
