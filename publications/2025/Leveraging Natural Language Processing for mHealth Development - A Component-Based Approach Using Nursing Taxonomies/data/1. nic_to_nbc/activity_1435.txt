Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "cleansing guide": {
        "parameters": [
            {"name": "detergent name", "description": "name of the detergent to be used"},
            {"name": "cleansing instructions", "description": "step-by-step instructions for cleansing"},
            {"name": "frequency", "description": "specify how often the cleansing should be repeated"}
        ]
    }
}


I removed the `deadline_date` parameter because it's not required. Let me know if you have any further questions!
