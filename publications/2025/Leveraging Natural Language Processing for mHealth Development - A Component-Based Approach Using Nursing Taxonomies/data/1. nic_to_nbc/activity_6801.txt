Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Attention Redirector": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {"Type": "text"},
      "Cue Type": {"Type": "options", "Options": ["audio", "visual", "vibration"]},
      "Cue Frequency": {"Type": "options", "Options": ["every 15 minutes", "every 30 minutes", "every hour"]},
      "Cue Message": {"Type": "text"},
      "Environmental Cues": {"Type": "options", "Options": []},
      "Frequency": {"Type": "options", "Options": ["daily", "every few hours", "as needed"]}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it is not applicable, and also removed the `Environmental Cues` options list as it was empty.
