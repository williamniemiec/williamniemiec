Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Hygiene Instruction": {
        "Parameters": {
            "Name": {"Type": "text"},
            "Content": {"Type": ["text", "multimedia"]},
            "Steps": {"Type": ["ordered list of text", "multimedia"]},
            "Frequency": {"Options": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"]},
            "Deadline Date": {"Type": "datetime"}
        }
    }
}


Note: I removed the "Task" element as it was not part of the original request, and also removed the "Not Applicable" parameters. Let me know if you need anything else!
