Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Physical Activity Assistance": {
    "Activity List": {
      "Description": "List of physical activities that require assistance",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "unordered list"
    },
    "Assistance Needed": {
      "Description": "Do you need assistance with any of these activities?",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "boolean"
    },
    "Frequency": {
      "Description": "How often do you need assistance with each activity?",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "options"
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Reminders` and `Caregiver Notification` parameters since they are not required. Let me know if this meets your requirements!
