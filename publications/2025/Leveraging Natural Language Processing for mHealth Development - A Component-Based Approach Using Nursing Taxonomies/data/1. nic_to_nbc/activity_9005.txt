Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Bed Adjustment Guide": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Title": {},
      "Description": {},
      "Image": {},
      "Angle": {},
      "Frequency": {}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it was marked as "datetime" which is not applicable in this context. Also, I only kept the parameter names and removed their types and options for brevity. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
