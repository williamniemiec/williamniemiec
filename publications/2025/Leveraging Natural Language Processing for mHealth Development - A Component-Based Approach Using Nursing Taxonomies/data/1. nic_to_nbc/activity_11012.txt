Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "name": "Indicate When Finished",
    "parameters": [
        {
            "name": "Finished Eating",
            "type": "boolean"
        },
        {
            "name": "Indication Method",
            "type": "options",
            "options": []
        },
        {
            "name": "Instructions",
            "type": "text"
        },
        {
            "name": "Visual Aids",
            "type": "multimedia"
        },
        {
            "name": "Reminders",
            "type": "boolean"
        },
        {
            "name": "Frequency",
            "type": "options",
            "options": []
        }
    ]
}


Note that I removed the `description` fields and other unnecessary information, and also removed the `required` field since it's not specified in the original format. Also, I didn't fill in the options for `Indication Method` and `Frequency` as they were not provided in the input text.
