Here is the output in JSON format:

{
  "Denture Reminder": {
    "Reminder Title": {},
    "Frequency": {
      "options": [
        { "value": "daily", "label": "Daily" },
        { "value": "onlyOnce", "label": "Only once" },
        { "value": "everyHours", "label": "Every x hours" },
        { "value": "everyDays", "label": "Every x days" }
      ]
    },
    "Deadline Date": {}
  }
}

Note that I removed the `Description` and `Type` fields, as well as the `Required` field, since they were not requested in the output. I also removed the `Content Type` parameter, as it was not part of the `Parameters` section. Let me know if you have any further questions!
