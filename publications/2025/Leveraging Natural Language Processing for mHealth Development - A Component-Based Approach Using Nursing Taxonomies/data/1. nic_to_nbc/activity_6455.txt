Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Assisted Exercise": {
        "parameters": [
            {"Name": "text"},
            {"Description": "text"},
            {"Exercise Type": "options"},
            {"Assistance Required": "options"},
            {"Instructions": "text"},
            {"Frequency": "options"}
        ]
    }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters, such as `Deadline Date` which is of type `datetime`, and kept only the relevant information. Let me know if this meets your requirements!
