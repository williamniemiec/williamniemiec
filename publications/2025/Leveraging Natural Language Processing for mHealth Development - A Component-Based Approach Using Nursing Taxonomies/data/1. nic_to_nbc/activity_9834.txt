Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Instruction": {
    "content": "the instructional content to be displayed"
  },
  "Image": {
    "image": "the image to be displayed",
    "description": "optional parameter to provide a brief description of the image"
  },
  "Reminder": {
    "content": "the reminder content to be displayed"
  },
  "Guided Relaxation": {
    "script": "the guided relaxation script to be played"
  }
}


Note: I removed the "not applicable" parameters, which means I didn't include any empty or null values in the output JSON.
