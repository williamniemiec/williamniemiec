Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "name": "Trigger Area Assessment",
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "trigger_areas",
      "type": "list"
    },
    {
      "name": "assessment_criteria",
      "type": "text"
    },
    {
      "name": "response_threshold",
      "type": "text"
    },
    {
      "name": "frequency",
      "type": "options"
    }
  ]
}


I removed the `description`, `content_type`, and `deadline_date` parameters as they were not requested. I also removed the `required`, `default`, `options`, and `label` properties as they were not part of the original request. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
