Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "name": "Body Position Monitoring",
    "parameters": [
        {
            "name": "body_parts",
            "description": "List of body parts to monitor"
        },
        {
            "name": "activities",
            "description": "List of daily activities to monitor body position during"
        },
        {
            "name": "monitoring_frequency",
            "description": "Specify how often to monitor body position"
        }
    ]
}


I removed the not applicable parameter `deadline_date` since it's optional and not required. Let me know if this meets your requirements!
