Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Token System": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {},
      "Behaviors": {},
      "Token/Point System": {
        "Options": ["points", "stars", "badges", "custom"]
      },
      "Rewards": {},
      "Frequency": {
        "Options": ["daily", "weekly", "monthly"]
      }
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it was not applicable. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
