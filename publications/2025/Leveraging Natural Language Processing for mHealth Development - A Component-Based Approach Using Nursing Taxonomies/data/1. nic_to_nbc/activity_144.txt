Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Relaxation Technique": {
    "Technique": {
      "type": "options",
      "options": ["forehead rub", "shoulder roll", "deep breathing", "progressive muscle relaxation", "etc."]
    },
    "Instructions": {
      "type": "text"
    },
    "Duration": {
      "type": "text",
      "example": "5-10 minutes"
    },
    "Frequency": {
      "type": "options",
      "options": ["daily", "every other day", "3 times a week", "etc."]
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it's not applicable to the no-code element, and also removed the introduction and conclusion parts of the text. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
