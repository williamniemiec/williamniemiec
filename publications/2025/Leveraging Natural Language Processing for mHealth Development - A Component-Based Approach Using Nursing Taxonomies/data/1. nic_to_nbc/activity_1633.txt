Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Instruction": {
    "instruction": {
      "Description": "Specific instruction to be given to the patient",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "text"
    },
    "reason": {
      "Description": "Explain why this instruction is important",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "text"
    }
  }
}


I removed all the unnecessary information and kept only the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` ("Instruction") and the `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the "Warning" parameter since it was marked as not required.
