Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Learning Environment": {
    "Parameters": [
      {"Learning Environment Assessment": {"Type": "text", "Required": true}},
      {"Recommendations": {"Type": "text/html", "Required": true}},
      {"Goal Setting": {"Type": "text", "Required": true}},
      {"Progress Tracking": {"Type": "datetime", "Required": true}}
    ]
  }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters (Resources and Family Involvement) since they are marked as Required: false. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
