Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Reiki Preparation": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Positioning": {
        "Type": "options",
        "Options": ["sitting comfortably", "lying down on a massage table"]
      },
      "Body Position": {
        "Type": "options",
        "Options": ["supine", "prone"]
      },
      "Clothing": {
        "Type": "boolean"
      }
    }
  }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters (`Relaxation` and `Comfort`) as they don't seem to be relevant to the specific intervention described. Let me know if you need anything else!
