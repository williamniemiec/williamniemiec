Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Catheterization Guide": {
        "Name": {"type": "text"},
        "Steps": {"type": "ordered list of text or images"},
        "Frequency": {"type": "options", "options": ["daily", "everyOtherDay", "every2Days", "every3Days", "etc."]},
        "Deadline Date": {"type": "datetime"},
        "Additional Resources": {"type": "text or link to external resource"},
        "Catheterization Log": {"type": "table or form with columns for date, time, and notes"}
    }
}


Note that I removed the `Video Tutorial` and `Catheterization Checklist` parameters as they were mentioned as additional possibilities but not actually part of the original parameter specifications.
