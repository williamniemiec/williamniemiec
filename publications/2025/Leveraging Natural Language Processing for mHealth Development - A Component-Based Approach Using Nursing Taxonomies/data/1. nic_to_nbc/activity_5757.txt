Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Special Specimen Collection Device Guide": {
    "Patient Type": {
      "type": "text or selection from a list of options",
      "required": true
    },
    "Specimen Type": {
      "type": "text or selection from a list of options",
      "required": true
    },
    "Device Type": {
      "type": "text or selection from a list of options",
      "required": true
    },
    "Application Instructions": {
      "type": "ordered list of instructions",
      "required": true
    }
  }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters (i.e., **Additional Tips**) and kept only the required ones. Let me know if this is what you were expecting!
