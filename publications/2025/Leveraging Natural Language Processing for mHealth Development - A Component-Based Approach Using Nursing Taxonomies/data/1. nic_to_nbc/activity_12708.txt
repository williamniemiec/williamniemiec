Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Pulmonary Secretion Tracker": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {"Type": "text"},
      "Frequency": {"Type": "options"},
      "Amount": {"Type": "number"},
      "Color": {"Type": "options"},
      "Consistency": {"Type": "options"},
      "Notes": {"Type": "text"}
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it's not applicable in this context, and also removed the introduction and conclusion parts of the text. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
