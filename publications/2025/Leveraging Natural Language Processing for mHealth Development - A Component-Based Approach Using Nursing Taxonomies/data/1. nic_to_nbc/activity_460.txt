Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Vital Sign Tracker": {
    "parameters": {
      "Vital Sign Type": {},
      "Frequency": {},
      "Unit": {},
      "Target Range": {}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed `Deadline Date` as it's not applicable since it's a datetime type and doesn't fit the format of the other parameters. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
