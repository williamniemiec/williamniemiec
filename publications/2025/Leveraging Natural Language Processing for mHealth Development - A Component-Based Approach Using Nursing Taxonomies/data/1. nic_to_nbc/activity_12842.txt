Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "No-code Element Name": "Cause Clarifier",
  "Parameters": {
    "Story Theme": {
      "Type": "options",
      "Options": ["I'm not to blame", "My brother/sister's illness is not my fault"]
    },
    "Story Content": {
      "Type": "interactive story"
    },
    "Interactive Elements": {
      "Type": "interactive elements"
    },
    "Reflection and Feedback": {
      "Type": "text"
    },
    "Frequency": {
      "Type": "options",
      "Options": ["daily", "weekly", "monthly", "onlyOnce"]
    }
  }
}


I removed the introduction, number, description, and conclusion parts of the text, as well as the "Content Type" parameter, which is not applicable. Let me know if this meets your requirements!
