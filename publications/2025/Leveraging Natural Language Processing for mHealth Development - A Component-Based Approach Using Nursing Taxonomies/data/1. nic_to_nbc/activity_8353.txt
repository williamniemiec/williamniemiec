Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "name": "Education",
    "parameters": [
        { 
            "name": "title", 
            "type": "text"
        },
        { 
            "name": "content", 
            "type": "text"
        },
        { 
            "name": "contraception_info", 
            "type": "text"
        },
        { 
            "name": "resources", 
            "type": "list of resources",
            "resources": [
                { 
                    "text": "Educational brochure on sexual function and therapy", 
                    "type": "text"
                },
                { 
                    "text": "Support group for patients with sexual dysfunction", 
                    "type": "text"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}


Note that I removed the "description" field as it was not requested in the output. Also, I assumed that all parameters are required and didn't include a "required" field. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
