Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Monitor Reading": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Reading Type": {"Type": "options"},
      "Frequency": {"Type": "options"},
      "Threshold Values": {"Type": "numerical values"}
    }
  }
}


I removed the "Notes" parameter as it's not applicable (no specific values or ranges were provided). Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
