Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "No-Code Element Name": "Tutorial",
  "Parameters": {
    "Device/Equipment": {"Type": "text"},
    "Tutorial Steps": {"Type": "list of tutorial steps"},
    "Quiz": {"Type": "list of quiz questions"},
    "Frequency": {"Options": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"]},
    "Deadline Date": {"Type": "datetime"}
  }
}

Note: I removed the `Content type` parameter as it was not included in the original format. If you want to include it, let me know!
