Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Expectation Setter": {
    "Condition Information": {"type": ["text", "video"]},
    "Realistic Expectations": {"type": ["text", "video"]},
    "Goal Setting": {"type": ["text", "interactive goal-setting tool"]},
    "Resources": {"type": "list of resources with links or descriptions"}
  }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters, which are `Family Involvement` (because its type is a boolean) and other text that's not part of the parameter specifications. Let me know if this meets your requirements!
