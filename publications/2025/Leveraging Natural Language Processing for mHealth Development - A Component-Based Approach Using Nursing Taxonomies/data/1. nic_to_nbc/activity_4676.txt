Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Breathing and Coughing Exercise": {
    "Exercise Instructions": {"Type": "text"},
    "Breathing Pattern": {"Type": "options"},
    "Coughing Pattern": {"Type": "options"},
    "Frequency": {"Options": ["daily", "weekly", "as prescribed"]},
    "Reminders": {"Type": "boolean"},
    "Tracking": {"Type": "boolean"}
  }
}


Note that I removed the non-applicable parameters and reformatted the text to conform to JSON syntax. Let me know if you have any further requests!
