Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "name": "Exercise Restriction",
    "parameters": [
        {
            "name": "Name",
            "type": "text"
        },
        {
            "name": "Exercise Type",
            "type": "options"
        },
        {
            "name": "Condition",
            "type": "options"
        },
        {
            "name": "Temperature Range",
            "type": "range"
        },
        {
            "name": "Additional Instructions",
            "type": "text"
        }
    ]
}


Note that I removed the `description` field and the `required` field, as well as the `options` array for the `Exercise Type` and `Condition` parameters, since they were not specified in the original request. Let me know if you need anything else!
