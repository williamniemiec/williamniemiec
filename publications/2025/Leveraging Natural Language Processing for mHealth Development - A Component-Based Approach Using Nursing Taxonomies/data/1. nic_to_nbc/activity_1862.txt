Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS": {
    "* Order and interpret laboratory tests (coagulation studies)": "",
    "* Review and analyze the results of these tests (PT, PTT, fibrinogen, fibrin degradation/split products, and platelet counts)": "",
    "* Use clinical judgment to determine the significance of the results and make decisions about patient care": ""
  },
  "NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME": null
}


Note that there is no specific `NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME` mentioned in the input text, so I left it as `null`. Also, I removed any non-applicable parameters from the `PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS`.
