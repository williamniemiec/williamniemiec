Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Residual Check Before Feeding": {
    "Feeding Type": {
      "Description": "Specify the type of feeding",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "options",
      "Options": [
        { "value": "intermittent", "label": "Intermittent feeding" }
      ]
    },
    "Residual Amount": {
      "Description": "Record the residual amount before feeding",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "number"
    },
    "Feeding Time": {
      "Description": "Record the time of feeding",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "datetime"
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Notes` parameter since it was not applicable (required=false). Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
