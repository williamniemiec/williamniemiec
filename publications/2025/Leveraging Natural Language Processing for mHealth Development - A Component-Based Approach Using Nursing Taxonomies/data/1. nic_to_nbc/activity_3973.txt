Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Splinting Guide": {
    "parameters": {
      "Splinting Method": {},
      "Instructions": {},
      "Frequency": {},
      "Tips and Precautions": {}
    }
  }
}


I removed the "Reminders" parameter since it's a boolean type and doesn't have any specific values or options. Let me know if you need anything else!
