Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Journal": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {"Type": "text"},
      "Type": {"Type": "options"},
      "Entries": {"Type": "list of entry fields"},
      "Frequency": {"Type": "options"},
      "Customization": {"Type": "boolean"}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the not applicable parameters, which are `Visualization` and `Analysis`, as they were mentioned as advanced features but not part of the main parameter specifications.
