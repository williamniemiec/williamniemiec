Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Communication Skills Guide": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {"Type": "text"},
      "Description": {"Type": "text"},
      "Effective Communication Strategies": {"Type": "list", "Items": ["list of effective communication strategies, with descriptions and examples"]},
      "Goal Setting": {"Type": "boolean"},
      "Reflection Exercises": {"Type": "list", "Items": ["list of reflection exercises, with space for patient response"]},
      "Resources": {"Type": "list", "Items": ["list of resources, with descriptions and contact information"]}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Reminders` parameter as it was marked as not applicable (boolean type without any items). Let me know if you need to include it.
