Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Voiding/Defecation Monitoring": {
        "Parameters": {
            "Name": {"Type": "text"},
            "Monitoring Frequency": {"Type": "options"},
            "Voiding/Defecation Parameters": {"Type": "options"},
            "Recording Method": {"Type": "options"},
            "Deadline Date": {"Type": "datetime"},
            "Additional Tips": {"Type": "text"}
        }
    }
}


I removed the introduction, conclusion, and other unnecessary text, and kept only the no-code element name and its parameter specifications. I also removed the "not applicable" parameters (there were none in this example). Let me know if you have any further requests!
