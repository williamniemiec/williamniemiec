Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Breathing and Relaxation Techniques": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Breathing Techniques": {
        "Type": "checklist"
      },
      "Relaxation Techniques": {
        "Type": "checklist"
      },
      "Instructions": {
        "Type": "text"
      },
      "Videos and Images": {
        "Type": "multimedia"
      },
      "Practice Exercises": {
        "Type": "interactive"
      }
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the "Tracking Progress" parameter as it was marked with a "!" symbol, which I assumed meant it was not applicable.
