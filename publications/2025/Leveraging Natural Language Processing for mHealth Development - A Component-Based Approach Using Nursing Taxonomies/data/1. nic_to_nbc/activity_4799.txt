Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "name": "Treatment Effects Documentation",
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "Treatments",
      "type": "list",
      "items": [
        {
          "treatment name": "",
          "start date": "",
          "end date": ""
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Effects",
      "type": "list",
      "items": [
        {
          "treatment name": "",
          "effect": "",
          "description": ""
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Upload Documents",
      "type": "file upload"
    }
  ]
}


Note that I removed the `description` field from each parameter, as well as the `required` field, since they were not specified in the original task. If you need those fields, please let me know!
