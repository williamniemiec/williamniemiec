Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Comfortable Positioning": {
    "parameters": [
      {"Position Options": {}},
      {"Position Instructions": {}},
      {"Position Images": {}},
      {"Comfort Level": {}}
    ]
  }
}


I removed `Deadline Date` as it's not applicable to the no-code element, and also removed the descriptions, types, and other details to simplify the output. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
