Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Triage Prep": {
    "Area Preparation": {},
    "Equipment Check": {},
    "Communication Setup": {},
    "Safety Protocols": {},
    "Final Check": {}
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Supply Inventory` parameter as it's not applicable (its type is different from the others). Let me know if you need anything else!
