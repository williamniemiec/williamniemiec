Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Medication Administration Guide": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": "text, required",
      "Instructions": "text or html, required",
      "Steps": "list of steps, required",
      "Frequency": "options, required",
      "Deadline date": "datetime, optional"
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the not applicable parameters (Videos, Images, Checklist, Reminders) as they are marked as optional. Let me know if you need anything else!
