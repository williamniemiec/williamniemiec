Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Guide": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "Safe Toys and Activities for Infants",
      "pages": [],
      "frequency": "onlyOnce"
    }
  },
  "Task": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "Provide Safe Toys and Activities for Infant",
      "content": "Please review the recommended safe toys and activities for your infant's age group and ensure a safe play environment.",
      "resources": [],
      "frequency": "onlyOnce"
    }
  }
}


I removed `deadline_date` from both elements since it was specified as "not required". Let me know if you need any further modifications!
