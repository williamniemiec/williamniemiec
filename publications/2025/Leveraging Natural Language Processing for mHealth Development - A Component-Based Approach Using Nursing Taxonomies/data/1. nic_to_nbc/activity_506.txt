Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Family Relationship Monitoring": {
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "family_members", "type": "list of text"},
      {"name": "relationship_metrics", "type": "options"},
      {"name": "monitoring_frequency", "type": "options"},
      {"name": "monitoring_method", "type": "options"},
      {"name": "alert_threshold", "type": "options"}
    ]
  }
}


I removed the `deadline_date` parameter since it's not applicable (i.e., its required field is set to false). Let me know if you have any further questions!
