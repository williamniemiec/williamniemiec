Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Rest and Immobilization": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {"Type": "text"},
      "Injured Body Part": {"Type": "text"},
      "Rest Instructions": {"Type": ["text", "multimedia"]},
      "Immobilization Methods": {"Type": ["text", "multimedia"]},
      "Frequency": {"Type": "options"},
      "Deadline Date": {"Type": "datetime"}
    }
  }
}


I removed the parameters that are not applicable, which in this case was only `"Pain Management"`. Let me know if you have any further questions!
