Here is the output in JSON format:


{
"Pain Tracker": {
  "parameters": {
    "Pain Level": {"type": "numeric scale"},
    "Pain Description": {"type": "text"},
    "TENS Use": {"type": "object with properties for TENS use and duration"},
    "Relief Rating": {"type": "numeric scale"},
    "Additional Notes": {"type": "text"},
    "Date and Time": {"type": "datetime"}
  }
}


I removed the introduction, conclusion, and any other unnecessary information, leaving only the no-code element name and its parameters. I also formatted the output in JSON format as requested. Let me know if you need anything else!
