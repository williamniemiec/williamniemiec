Here is the output in JSON format:

{
  "beverage_reminder": {
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "beverage_type"},
      {"name": "frequency"},
      {"name": "carry_reminder"}
    ]
  }
}

I removed all unnecessary information and only kept the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the not applicable parameter `"deadline_date"` since it's not required. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
