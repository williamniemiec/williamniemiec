Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Resource Referral": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Resource Type": {},
      "Resource Name": {},
      "Description": {},
      "Contact Information": {},
      "Website": {}
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it is marked as `(if applicable)` and there was no value provided, so I considered it not applicable. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
