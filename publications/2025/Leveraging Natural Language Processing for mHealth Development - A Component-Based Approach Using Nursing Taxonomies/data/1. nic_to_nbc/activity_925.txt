Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Pillow Support Guidance": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Designated Position": {
        "Type": "options"
      },
      "Pillow Placement": {
        "Type": "text"
      },
      "Number of Pillows": {
        "Type": "number"
      }
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the "Pillow Adjustment" parameter since its type is boolean and it's not applicable in this context.
