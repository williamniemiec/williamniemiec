Here is the output in JSON format:

{
  "Rest": {
    "parameters": [
      {
        "name": "Duration",
        "type": "text"
      },
      {
        "name": "Frequency",
        "type": "options"
      },
      {
        "name": "Instructions",
        "type": "text"
      }
    ]
  }
}

I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it was marked as not applicable (i.e., `required`: `false`). Let me know if this is correct!
