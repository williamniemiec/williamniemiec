Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Educational Material Selection": {
    "Learning Objectives": {},
    "Learning Style": {},
    "Material Types": {},
    "Material Options": {},
    "Selection Criteria": {},
    "Recommended Materials": {}
  }
}


Note that I removed all parameters that were marked as "Not Applicable" or didn't have a corresponding parameter specification. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
