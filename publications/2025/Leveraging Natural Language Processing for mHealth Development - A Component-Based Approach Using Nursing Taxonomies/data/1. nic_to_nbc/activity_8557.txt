Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Temperament Assessment": {
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "Questions", "type": "list of questions"},
      {"name": "Answer Options", "type": "list of options"},
      {"name": "Scoring", "type": "scoring rules"},
      {"name": "Results", "type": "text or graphical representation"},
      {"name": "Frequency", "type": "options"}
    ]
  }
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it's not applicable (i.e., its `required` field is set to `false`). Let me know if you have any further questions!
