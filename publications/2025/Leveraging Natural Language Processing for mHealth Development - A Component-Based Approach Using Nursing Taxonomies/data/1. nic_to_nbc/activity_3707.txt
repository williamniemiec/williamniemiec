Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Shivering Tracker": {
    "Frequency": {"type": "options"},
    "Shivering Scale": {"type": "options"},
    "Duration": {"type": "text"}
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it's not applicable to a no-code element, and also removed any other text that was not part of the parameter specifications. Let me know if you need anything else!
