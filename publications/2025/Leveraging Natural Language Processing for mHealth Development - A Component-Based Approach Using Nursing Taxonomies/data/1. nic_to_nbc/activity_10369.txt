Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Privacy and Draping Guide": {
    "Title": {"Description": "Title of the privacy and draping guide", "Required": true, "Type": "text"},
    "Instructions": {"Description": "Step-by-step instructions for draping the patient", "Required": true, "Type": "text"}
  }
}


I removed all unnecessary information and only kept the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the not applicable parameters (i.e., the ones with `Required: false`). Let me know if this is what you were expecting!
