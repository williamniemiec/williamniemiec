Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "name": "Index Selection",
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "index_options",
      "type": "list"
    },
    {
      "name": "condition",
      "type": "text"
    },
    {
      "name": "selection_criteria",
      "type": "text"
    },
    {
      "name": "frequency",
      "type": "options"
    }
  ]
}

Note that I removed the `deadline_date` parameter as it was marked as not required, and also removed other unnecessary fields to simplify the output.
