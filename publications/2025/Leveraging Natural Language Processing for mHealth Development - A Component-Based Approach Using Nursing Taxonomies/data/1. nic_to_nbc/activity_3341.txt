Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Breastfeeding Guide": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {},
      "Content": {},
      "Frequency": {},
      "Deadline Date": {}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Condition` parameter since it was marked as "not applicable" (its type is a conditional statement, which is not a typical parameter type). Let me know if you'd like me to include it anyway!
