Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "TPN Symptom Reporter": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Symptom Type": {},
      "Symptom Severity": {},
      "Symptom Description": {},
      "TPN Administration": {},
      "Physician Notification": {},
      "Care Modification": {},
      "Deadline Date": {}
    }
  }
}


I removed the "Notes" parameter as it's not applicable in this context. Let me know if you need anything else!
