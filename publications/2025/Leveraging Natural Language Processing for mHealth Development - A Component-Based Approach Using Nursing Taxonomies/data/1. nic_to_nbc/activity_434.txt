Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Laundry Assistance": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Laundry Type": {"Type": "options"},
      "Current Status": {"Type": "text"},
      "Cleaning Options": {"Type": "list of text or HTML content"},
      "Step-by-Step Guide": {"Type": "list of text or HTML content"},
      "Frequency": {"Type": "options"}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Reminders` parameter since it's a boolean type, and you mentioned to remove not applicable parameters. If you want to include it, just let me know!
