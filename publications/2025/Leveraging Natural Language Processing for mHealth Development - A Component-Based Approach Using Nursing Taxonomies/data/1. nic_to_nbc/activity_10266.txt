Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Procedure": {
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "steps", "description": "list of steps to follow"},
      {"name": "cdc_guidelines", "description": "link to current CDC guidelines for peripheral IV and central line site and dressing change"},
      {"name": "frequency", "description": "specify how often the procedure should be repeated"},
    ]
  }
}


I removed the introduction, conclusion, and not applicable parameters (deadline_date). Let me know if this meets your requirements!
