Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Energy Management Plan": {
    "Activity Types": {"type": "list of text options", "required": true},
    "Rest Periods": {"type": "numeric value (in minutes) and options", "required": true},
    "Activity Durations": {"type": "numeric value (in minutes)", "required": true},
    "Schedule": {"type": "calendar-based schedule with time slots", "required": true}
  }
}


I removed the non-applicable parameters (`Energy Levels` and `Reminders`) as they are not required. Let me know if this meets your requirements!
