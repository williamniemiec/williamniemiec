Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Temperature Setting": {
    "instruction title": {},
    "device to set temperature": {},
    "temperature range to set": {
      "min": 120,
      "max": 130,
      "unit": "degrees Fahrenheit"
    },
    "reason for the instruction": {},
    "frequency of the instruction": {
      "options": [
        { "value": "once", "label": "Once" },
        { "value": "daily", "label": "Daily" },
        { "value": "weekly", "label": "Weekly" },
        { "value": "monthly", "label": "Monthly" }
      ]
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it was marked as not required. Let me know if you need anything else!
