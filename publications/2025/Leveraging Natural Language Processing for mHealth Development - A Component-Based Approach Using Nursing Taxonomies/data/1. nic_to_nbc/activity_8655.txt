Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Preparation Guide": {
    "Test Name": {
      "Description": "Name of the diagnostic test",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "text"
    },
    "Test Description": {
      "Description": "Description of the diagnostic test",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "text"
    },
    "Preparation Steps": {
      "Description": "List of steps to prepare for the diagnostic test",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "unordered list"
    },
    "What to Expect": {
      "Description": "Information about what to expect during the diagnostic test",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "text"
    }
  }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters (Frequently Asked Questions) since they are marked as `Required: false`. Let me know if this is correct!
