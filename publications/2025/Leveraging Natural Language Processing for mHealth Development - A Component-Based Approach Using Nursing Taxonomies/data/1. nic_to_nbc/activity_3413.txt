Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Visitor Management": {
    "parameters": [
      {"Name": {"type": "text"}},
      {"Visitor Limit": {"type": "number"}},
      {"Visitor Schedule": {"type": "schedule"}},
      {"Interruption Settings": {"type": "options"}},
      {"Frequency": {"type": "options"}}
    ]
  }
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it was marked as not required. Let me know if you need anything else!
