Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Shock Communication": {
    "Communication Strategy": {
      "Type": "text"
    },
    "Emotional Support": {
      "Type": "text"
    },
    "Reassurance": {
      "Type": "text"
    },
    "Resources": {
      "Type": "list of resources"
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the "Not Applicable" parameters, which in this case were the fields related to the **Support Network** no-code element, as they are not part of the original {{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}.
