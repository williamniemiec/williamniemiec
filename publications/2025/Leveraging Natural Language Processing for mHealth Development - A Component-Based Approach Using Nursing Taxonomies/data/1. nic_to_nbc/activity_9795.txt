Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "name": "Stress Reduction Promotion",
    "parameters": [
        { 
            "name": "Techniques", 
            "type": "options"
        },
        { 
            "name": "Frequency", 
            "type": "options"
        },
        { 
            "name": "Duration", 
            "type": "text"
        }
    ]
}


I removed the `Additional Resources` parameter since it's not applicable (i.e., it's optional and doesn't have a specific value). Let me know if you need any further assistance!
