Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Information Review": {
        "information review title": {"Type": "text", "Required": true},
        "Information": {"Type": ["text", "summary"], "Required": true},
        "Health Care Professionals": {"Type": "list of professional objects", "Required": true}
    }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters ("Reinforcement" and "Questions") since they are optional (required: false). Let me know if this meets your requirements!
