Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Oxygen Delivery Device Education": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Oxygen Delivery Device Education Goal": {},
      "Importance of Leaving Oxygen Delivery Device On": {},
      "Consequences of Not Leaving Oxygen Delivery Device On": {},
      "Tips for Leaving Oxygen Delivery Device On": {},
      "Oxygen Delivery Device Education Frequency": {}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Items` array from the `Tips` parameter and the `Options` array from the `Frequency` parameter, as they are not applicable in this format. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
