Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Bite-Sized Information": {
    "Information": {"Description": "Information to be presented in small, concrete portions", "Type": "text"},
    "Portion Size": {"Description": "Size of each portion of information", "Type": "options", "Options": [{"value": "shortSentence", "label": "Short Sentence"}, {"value": "paragraph", "label": "Paragraph"}, {"value": "listItem", "label": "List Item"}]},
    "Number of Portions": {"Description": "Number of portions of information to present", "Type": "number"}
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Presentation Order` parameter since it's not required. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
