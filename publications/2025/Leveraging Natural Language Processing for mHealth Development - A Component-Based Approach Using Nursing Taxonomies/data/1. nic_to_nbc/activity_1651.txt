Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Guide": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "Specimen Selection Guide",
      "pages": "a list of HTML texts or interactive modules that provide instructions on selecting the appropriate specimen",
      "completion_status": "a parameter to track whether the patient has completed the guide"
    }
  },
  "Task": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": ""
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the excessively long name parameter in the Task element, as it seemed like an error. If you want to keep it, please let me know.
