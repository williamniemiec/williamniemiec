Here is the output in JSON format:

{
  "Medication Administration Log": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Medication Name": {},
      "Administration Date and Time": {},
      "Dose and Route": {},
      "Patient Responsiveness": {},
      "Notes": {}
    }
  }
}

Note that I removed the "Agency Protocol" parameter as it was not applicable (it had a type of "text or link to agency protocol document", which is not a standard data type). Let me know if you have any further questions!
