Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Nutrition Requirements Assessment": {
    "parameters": {
      "Patient Information": {"type": "form with multiple fields"},
      "Nutrition Goals": {"type": "text or selection from a list"},
      "Caloric Needs": {"type": "calculated field (using a nutrition algorithm or API)"},
      "Macronutrient Requirements": {"type": "calculated field (using a nutrition algorithm or API)"},
      "Micronutrient Requirements": {"type": "calculated field (using a nutrition algorithm or API)"},
      "Dietitian Review": {"type": "checkbox or boolean"}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the `*` symbols and reformatted the output to conform to JSON syntax.
