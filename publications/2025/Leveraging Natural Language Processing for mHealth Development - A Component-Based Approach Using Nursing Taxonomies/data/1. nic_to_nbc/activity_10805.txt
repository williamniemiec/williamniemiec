Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "fluid intake tracking": {
        "parameters": [
            {"name": "goal", "description": "minimum daily fluid intake goal"},
            {"name": "unit", "description": "unit of measurement for fluid intake"},
            {"name": "frequency", "description": "specify how often to track fluid intake"}
        ]
    }
}


Note: I removed the `deadline_date` parameter since it's not applicable (required is false).
