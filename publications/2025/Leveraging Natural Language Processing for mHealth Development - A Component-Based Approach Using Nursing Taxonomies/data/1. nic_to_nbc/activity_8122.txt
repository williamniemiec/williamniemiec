Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Portion Control Guide": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Portion Size Guidelines": {"Type": "text or HTML"},
      "Meal Planning Tips": {"Type": "list of text or HTML"},
      "Food Measurement Tools": {"Type": "list of text or HTML"},
      "Benefits Information": {"Type": "text or HTML"}
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Frequency` parameter since it's not applicable to this specific no-code element. Let me know if you have any further requests!
