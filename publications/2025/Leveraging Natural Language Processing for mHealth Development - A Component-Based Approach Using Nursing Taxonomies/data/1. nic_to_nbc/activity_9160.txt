Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Instruction": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {},
      "Body Part": {},
      "Immobilization/Support Method": {},
      "Instructions": {},
      "Frequency": {}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it was marked as `- Type: datetime` which is not applicable in this context.
