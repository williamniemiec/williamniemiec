Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Medication Education": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Medication Name": {"Type": "text", "Required": true},
      "Expected Actions": {"Type": "text", "Required": true},
      "Adverse Effects": {"Type": "unordered list", "Required": true}
    }
  }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters (Precautions, Interactive Elements, Frequency, and Deadline Date) since they have Required: false. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
