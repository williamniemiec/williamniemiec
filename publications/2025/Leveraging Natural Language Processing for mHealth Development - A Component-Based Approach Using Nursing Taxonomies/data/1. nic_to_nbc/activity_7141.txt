Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Procedure Explanation": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Procedure Overview": {"Type": "text or video content"},
      "Sensations": {"Type": "text or video content"},
      "FAQs": {"Type": "list of objects with properties (e.g., question, answer)"},
      "Visual Aids": {"Type": "image or diagram"},
      "Anxiety Reduction": {"Type": "text or audio content"}
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Consent` parameter as it was marked as a boolean type, which is not applicable in this context. Let me know if you have any further questions!
