Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Parameters": [
    {
      "Name": "Stress Management Questions",
      "Description": "Answer questions to identify your methods of handling stress"
    },
    {
      "Name": "Stress Management Profile",
      "Description": "View your stress management profile"
    }
  ],
  "NoCodeElementName": "Stress Management Assessment"
}


I removed the not applicable parameters and only kept the `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}` and `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` as per your request. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
