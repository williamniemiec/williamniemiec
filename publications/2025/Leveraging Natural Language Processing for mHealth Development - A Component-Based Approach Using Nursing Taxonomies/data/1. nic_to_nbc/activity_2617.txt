Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Breaking Suction Guidance": {
    "Step-by-Step Instructions": {
      "Type": "ordered list",
      "Example": ["Insert a finger into the corner of the baby's mouth", "Gently press down on the lower gum to release the suction", "Remove the baby from the breast"]
    },
    "Visual Aids": {
      "Type": "media (image or video)",
      "Optional": true
    },
    "Frequency": {
      "Type": "options",
      "Options": ["everyFeeding", "everyXFeedings", "atWill"]
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it was marked as optional and didn't have a specified value.
