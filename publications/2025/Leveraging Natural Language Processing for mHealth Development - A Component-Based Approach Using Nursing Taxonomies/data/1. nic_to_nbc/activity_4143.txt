Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Agency Form": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Form Type": [],
      "Fields": {
        "Text fields": [],
        "Checkbox fields": [],
        "Date fields": []
      },
      "Agency Specific": [],
      "Care Activities": [],
      "Baseline Assessments": [],
      "Validation Rules": []
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the introduction and conclusion, as well as the number and description of the no-code element. I also removed the "not applicable" parameters, which in this case were none. The resulting JSON object has the no-code element name "Agency Form" with its corresponding parameters.
