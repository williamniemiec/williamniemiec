Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Academic Goal Setter": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Academic Goal": {
        "Type": "text",
        "Required": true
      },
      "Goal Setting": {
        "Type": "text/html",
        "Required": true
      },
      "Motivational Messages": {
        "Type": "text/html",
        "Required": true
      },
      "Progress Tracking": {
        "Type": "datetime",
        "Required": true
      }
    }
  }
}


I removed the non-applicable parameters (Reward System and Academic Resources) as they have `Required: false`. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
