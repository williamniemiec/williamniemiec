Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Supportive Environment": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": {"type": "text"},
      "behavior": {"type": "text"},
      "resources": {"type": "list of resource objects", "properties": ["title", "description", "url"]},
      "coaching": {"type": "text"},
      "community": {"type": "text"},
      "tracking": {"type": "text"}
    }
  }
}


Let me know if this is what you were expecting!
