Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Emergency Contact Information": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {
        "Type": "text"
      },
      "Description": {
        "Type": "text"
      },
      "Emergency Services": {
        "Type": "options",
        "Options": ["police", "local health department", "poison control center"]
      },
      "Phone Numbers": {
        "Type": "text or link to external resource"
      },
      "Additional Resources": {
        "Type": "text or link to external resource"
      }
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Here's a no-code element...` introduction, the `This no-code element can be connected...` conclusion, and only kept the relevant information. Also, I assumed that the list of emergency services options is not exhaustive and only included the examples provided in the input text.
