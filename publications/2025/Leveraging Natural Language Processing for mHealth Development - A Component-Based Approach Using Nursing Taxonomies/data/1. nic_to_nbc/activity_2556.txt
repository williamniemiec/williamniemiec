Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Conversation": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Topic": {"Type": "text"},
      "Role": {"Type": "options"},
      "Questions": {"Type": "list of text"},
      "Notes": {"Type": "text"},
      "Schedule": {"Type": "options"}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the not applicable parameters, which are `Video/Audio` and `Transcript`, as they were listed under advanced features. If you want to include them, let me know!
