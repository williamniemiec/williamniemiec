Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Boundary Setter": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {"Type": "text"},
      "Intrusive Behaviors": {"Type": "list of text"},
      "Boundary Setting Strategies": {"Type": "list of text or multimedia content"},
      "Scenario-Based Exercises": {"Type": "list of interactive exercises"},
      "Reflection Questions": {"Type": "list of text"},
      "Frequency": {"Type": "options"}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it's not applicable in this context. Let me know if you have any further questions!
