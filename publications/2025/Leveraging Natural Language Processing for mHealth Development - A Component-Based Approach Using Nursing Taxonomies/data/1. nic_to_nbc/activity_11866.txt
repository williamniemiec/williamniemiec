Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Safe Storage": {
    "instruction title": {},
    "Hazardous Substances": {},
    "Storage Location": {},
    "Reason": {},
    "Frequency": {},
    "Deadline Date": {}
  }
}


Note that I removed the "Content Type" parameter as it's not applicable. Also, I didn't include the "Description" and other metadata for each parameter, only keeping the parameter names. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
