Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Family Threat Assessment": {
    "parameters": {
      "Event Type": {"type": "options"},
      "Event Description": {"type": "text"},
      "Impact": {"type": "scale"},
      "Timing": {"type": "datetime"},
      "Family Members Affected": {"type": "checklist"}
    }
  }
}


I removed the following:

* Introduction and conclusion sections
* Parameters that were marked as "not applicable" (none in this case)
* The `Frequency` and `Deadline Date` parameters, as they seem to be related to scheduling or timing of the assessment, rather than being specific to the no-code element itself.
