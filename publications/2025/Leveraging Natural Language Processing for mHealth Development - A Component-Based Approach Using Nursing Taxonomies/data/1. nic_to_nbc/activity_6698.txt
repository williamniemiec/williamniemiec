Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Medication Administration": {
    "name": {"type": "text"},
    "medication_name": {"type": "text"},
    "concentration": {"type": "options", "options": ["1%", "2%"]},
    "administration_site": {"type": "text"},
    "notes": {"type": "text"}
  }
}


I removed the following:

* The introduction and conclusion sections
* The `frequency` parameter, as it has a complex type (`options`) with multiple values, which are not applicable in this context.
* The `deadline_date` parameter, as it is not relevant to the medication administration guidance.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
