Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Positioning Guide": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {},
      "Position Type": {},
      "Instructions": {},
      "Image or Video": {}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the "Frequency" parameter as it was marked as "Not Applicable" since it has options with variables (e.g. "Every x hours", "Every x days") which are not applicable in this context.
