Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "name": "Mood Check-in",
    "parameters": [
        {
            "name": "Emotion Options"
        },
        {
            "name": "Intensity Scale"
        },
        {
            "name": "Reflection Prompt"
        },
        {
            "name": "Frequency"
        }
    ]
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it's not applicable (i.e., its required field is set to false). Let me know if you need any further modifications!
