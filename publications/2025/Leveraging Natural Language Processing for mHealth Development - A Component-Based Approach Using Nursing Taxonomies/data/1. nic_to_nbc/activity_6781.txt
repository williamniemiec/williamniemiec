I removed all the unnecessary information and kept only the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the not applicable parameters (`Tips and Reminders`, `Resources`, and `Questions`). The output is a JSON object with the no-code element name as the key, and an object containing the parameter specifications as the value.
