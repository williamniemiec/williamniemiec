Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Vital Sign Monitoring": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Vital Signs": {
        "type": "multi-select options"
      },
      "Frequency": {
        "type": "options"
      },
      "Units": {
        "type": "text"
      },
      "Target Range": {
        "type": "text"
      }
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it was marked as "datetime" which is not applicable in this context.
