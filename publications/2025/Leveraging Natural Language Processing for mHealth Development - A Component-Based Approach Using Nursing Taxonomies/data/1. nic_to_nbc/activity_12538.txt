Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Amniotomy Assistant": {
        "Name": {"type": "text"},
        "Amniotomy Indications": {"type": "list of text or options"},
        "Procedure Description": {"type": "text"},
        "Contraindications": {"type": "list of text or options"},
        "Pre-Procedure Checklist": {"type": "list of text or options"},
        "Procedure Steps": {"type": "list of text or options"},
        "Post-Procedure Care": {"type": "list of text or options"}
    }
}


Note that I removed the introduction and conclusion sections, as well as the content type specification. I also reformatted the parameter specifications to fit a JSON structure. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
