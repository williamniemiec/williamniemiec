Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Caregiver Response": {
    "parameters": {
      "Cue": {},
      "Response": {},
      "Response Timing": {},
      "Response Frequency": {}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed `Deadline Date` parameter as it was not applicable (no value or empty). Let me know if you want to include it in the output.
