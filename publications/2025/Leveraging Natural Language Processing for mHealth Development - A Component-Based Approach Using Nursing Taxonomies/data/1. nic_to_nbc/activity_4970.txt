Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "IV Fluid Restriction": {
    "alert message": {
      "Description": "Message to alert the patient to avoid hypotonic IV fluids",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "text"
    },
    "Reason": {
      "Description": "Explain why hypotonic IV fluids should be avoided",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "text"
    }
  }
}


I removed the "Allowed IV Fluids" parameter since it's not required. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
