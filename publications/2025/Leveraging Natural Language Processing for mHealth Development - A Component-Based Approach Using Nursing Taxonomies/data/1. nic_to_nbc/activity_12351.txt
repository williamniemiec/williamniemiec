Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Support Circle": {
    "Topic Categories": {"Type": "options"},
    "Matching Algorithm": {"Type": "internal algorithm"},
    "Discussion Forum": {"Type": "internal feature or integration with existing platforms"},
    "Moderation": {"Type": "internal feature or integration with existing platforms"},
    "Frequency": {"Type": "options"},
    "Deadline Date": {"Type": "datetime"}
  }
}


I removed all unnecessary text and only kept the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` ("Support Circle") and the `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also formatted the output as a JSON object. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
