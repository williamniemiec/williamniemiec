Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Instructional Video": {
    "video title": {},
    "Video Content": {},
    "Frequency": {}
  }
}


I removed all unnecessary information and kept only the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` ("Instructional Video") and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the "Deadline Date" parameter since it's marked as not required. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
