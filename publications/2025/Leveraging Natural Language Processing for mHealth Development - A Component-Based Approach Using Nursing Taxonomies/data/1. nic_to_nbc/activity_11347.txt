Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Lactation Support for Preterm Infant": {
    "Plan Title": {},
    "Pumping Frequency Instructions": {},
    "Milk Supply Increase Expectations": {},
    "Normal Feeding Patterns by Gestational Age": {},
    "Weaning from Pump Instructions": {},
    "Personalized Lactation Plan": {},
    "Follow-up Frequency": {
      "options": [
        {"value": "daily", "label": "Daily"},
        {"value": "weekly", "label": "Weekly"},
        {"value": "monthly", "label": "Monthly"}
      ]
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it's marked as not required. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
