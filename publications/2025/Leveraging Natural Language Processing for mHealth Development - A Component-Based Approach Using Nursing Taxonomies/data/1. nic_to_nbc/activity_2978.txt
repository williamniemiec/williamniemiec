Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Emotion Modulation Guide": {
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "Name", "type": "text"},
      {"name": "Methods", "type": "unordered list", "options": ["Assertiveness training", "Relaxation techniques", "Writing in a journal", "Distraction"]},
      {"name": "Description", "type": "text"},
      {"name": "Instructions", "type": "text"}
    ]
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Resources` parameter as it was not applicable (had an option for "Other methods can be added as needed"). Let me know if you need any further modifications!
