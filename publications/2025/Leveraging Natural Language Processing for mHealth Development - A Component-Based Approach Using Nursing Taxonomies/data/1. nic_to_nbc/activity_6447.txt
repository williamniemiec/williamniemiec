Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Protocol": {
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "steps", "description": "list of steps to follow", "type": "list"},
      {"name": "system_components", "description": "list of system components to maintain", "type": "list"},
      {"name": "frequency", "description": "specify how often the protocol should be repeated", "type": "options"},
    ]
  }
}


I removed all non-applicable parameters, including `content_type`, `deadline_date` (since it's not required), and the inner lists of steps and system components. Let me know if you'd like me to adjust anything!
