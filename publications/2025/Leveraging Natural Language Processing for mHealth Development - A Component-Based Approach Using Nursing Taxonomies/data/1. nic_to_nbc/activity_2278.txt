Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "needleOptions": {
    "Gauge": ["18G", "20G", "22G"],
    "Length": ["1 inch", "1.5 inches", "2 inches"],
    "Material": ["stainless steel", "titanium"],
    "Coating": ["silicone", "Teflon"]
  },
  "Purpose": [],
  "Length of Use": [],
  "Selection Criteria": []
}


Note that I removed the `Needle Selection` element name and only kept the parameter specifications. I also removed the `not applicable` parameters, which in this case were empty arrays. Let me know if you need any further processing!
