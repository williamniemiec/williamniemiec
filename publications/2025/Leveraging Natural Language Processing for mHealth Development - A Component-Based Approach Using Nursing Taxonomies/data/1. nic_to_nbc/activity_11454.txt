Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Preparation": {
    "Protocol": {},
    "Agent": {},
    "Dosage": {},
    "Preparation Steps": {},
    "Verification": {}
  }
}


Note: I removed the "Next Step" parameter as it seems not applicable to the no-code element "Preparation". Let me know if you need any further assistance!
