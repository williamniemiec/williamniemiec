Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "tracker": [
    {
      "name": "name",
      "description": "tracker title"
    },
    {
      "name": "intake_type",
      "description": "type of intake to track"
    },
    {
      "name": "output_type",
      "description": "type of output to track"
    },
    {
      "name": "frequency",
      "description": "specify how often to track intake and output"
    }
  ]
}


I removed the not applicable parameters (i.e., `deadline_date` which is optional) and kept only the required ones. Let me know if this meets your requirements!
