Here is the output in JSON format:

  "Parameters": {
    "Play Activity Name": {
      "Description": "Name of the play activity (e.g. Hide and Seek)",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "text"
    },
    "Instructions": {
      "Description": "Step-by-step instructions for the play activity",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "text or illustrated guide"
    },
    "Frequency": {

      "Required": true,
      "Type": "options",
      "Options": ["daily", "everyOtherDay", "threeTimesAWeek", "etc."]
    }
  }
}
