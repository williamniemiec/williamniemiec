Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "TENS Recommendation Assessment": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Assessment Questions": {"Description": "List of questions to assess patient's suitability for TENS", "Required": true, "Type": "list"},
      "Answer Options": {"Description": "List of answer options for each question", "Required": true, "Type": "list"},
      "Scoring": {"Description": "Scoring system to determine suitability for TENS", "Required": true, "Type": "scoring system"},
      "Recommendation": {"Description": "Generate a recommendation for TENS based on assessment results", "Required": true, "Type": "text"}
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Rationale` parameter since it's not required. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
