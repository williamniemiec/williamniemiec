Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Ambulatory Aid Instruction": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Ambulatory Aid Type": {},
      "Instructional Content": {},
      "Demonstration": {},
      "Proper Use Techniques": {},
      "Safety Precautions": {},
      "Tips and Reminders": {}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Practice Exercises` parameter as it was not applicable in this context. Let me know if you have any further questions!
