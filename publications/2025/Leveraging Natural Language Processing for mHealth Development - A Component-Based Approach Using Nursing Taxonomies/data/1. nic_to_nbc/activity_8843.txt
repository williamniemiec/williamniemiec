Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Regression Education": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Explanation": {"Type": "text or video"},
      "Stressors": {"Type": "list of options"}
      "Normalcy": {"Type": "boolean"},
      "Reassurance": {"Type": "boolean"}
    }
  }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters, which are **Content Type** and **Additional Resources**, as they don't have any values specified. Let me know if this is correct!
