Here is the output in JSON format, removing everything except `PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS` and `NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME`, and removing not applicable parameters:


{
    "name": "Hair Brushing or Combing",
    "parameters": [
        {
            "name": "Hair Brushing or Combing Tool Selection"
        },
        {
            "name": "Hair Brushing or Combing Instructions"
        },
        {
            "name": "Hair Tangle or Knot Detection"
        },
        {
            "name": "Tangle or Knot Resolution"
        },
        {
            "name": "Hair Brushing or Combing Frequency"
        }
    ]
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it's not directly related to the no-code element's functionality. If you want to keep it, just let me know!
