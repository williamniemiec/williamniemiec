Here is the output in JSON format, with only the `PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS` and `NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME` retained:

json
{
    "Vital Sign Tracker": {
        "parameters": [
            {"Vital Sign Type": {}},
            {"Frequency": {}},
            {"Deadline Date": {}},
            {"Unit": {}},
            {"Target Range": {}}
        ]
    }
}


Note that I removed the `description`, `type`, and other details for each parameter, as per your request. If you need those details, please let me know!
