Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Caregiver Strengths and Weaknesses Assessment": {
    "Name": {
      "Type": "text"
    },
    "Assessment Questions": {
      "Type": "list of questions (with text, options, and scales)"
    },
    "Strengths Categories": {
      "Type": "list of options (with text and icons)"
    },
    "Weaknesses Categories": {
      "Type": "list of options (with text and icons)"
    },
    "Reflection Prompts": {
      "Type": "list of text prompts (with options for customization)"
    }
  }
}


I removed all unnecessary information and kept only the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also reformatted the parameters to have a more JSON-like structure. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
