Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Resource Identification and Acquisition": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {"Type": "text"},
      "Activity selection": {"Type": "text", "Example": ["Walking", "Swimming", "Yoga"]},
      "Resource identification prompts": {"Type": "list of text", "Example": ["What equipment do you need for this activity?", "What training or instruction do you need?", "What support system do you need in place?"]},
      "Resource options": {"Type": "list of text", "Example": ["Walking shoes", "Swim goggles", "Yoga mat", "Personal trainer", "Online tutorial"]},
      "Resource acquisition options": {"Type": "list of text", "Example": ["Purchase online", "Borrow from a friend", "Rent from a local store", "Take a class or workshop"]},
      "Frequency": {"Type": "options", "Options": ["Daily", "Weekly", "Monthly"]},
      "Deadline date": {"Type": "datetime"}
    }
  }
}


I removed the introduction, description, and conclusion sections, as well as the not applicable parameters. The output is a JSON object with the no-code element name as the key, and its parameters as the value. Each parameter has its type and example values (if available) listed.
