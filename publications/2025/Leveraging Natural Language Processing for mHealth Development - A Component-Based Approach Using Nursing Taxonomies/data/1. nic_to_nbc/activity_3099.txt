Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Game Rule Modifier": {
        "Parameters": {
            "Game Type": {},
            "Age Range": {},
            "Ability Level": {},
            "Modification Suggestions": {},
            "Rule Adjustment": {}
        }
    }
}


Note: I removed `Safety Considerations` as it was not applicable, and only kept the parameters that were specified.
