Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Medication Selection": {
        "Title": {},
        "Content": {},
        "Key Points": {},
        "Frequency": {
            "options": [
                {"value": "daily", "label": "Daily"},
                {"value": "onlyOnce", "label": "Only once"},
                {"value": "everyHours", "label": "Every x hours"},
                {"value": "everyDays", "label": "Every x days"}
            ]
        }
    }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it was marked as not required. Let me know if you have any further questions!
