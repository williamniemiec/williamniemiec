Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Tracking": {
    "Metrics": ["Vital capacity", "Maximal inspiratory force", "Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)", "FEV1/FVC"],
    "Unit": [],
    "Frequency": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"],
    "Deadline Date": []
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Introduction` and `Conclusion` sections, as well as the `Parameters:` header. I also removed the `Type: datetime` specification for `Deadline Date`, as it's not a parameter value. Let me know if you'd like me to make any changes!
