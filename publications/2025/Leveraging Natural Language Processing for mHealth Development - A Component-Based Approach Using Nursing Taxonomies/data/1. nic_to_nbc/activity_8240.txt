Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Exercise Plan": {
    "parameters": [
      {"Name": {"type": "text"}},
      {"Exercise Type": {"type": "options", "options": []}},
      {"Muscle Groups": {"type": "options", "options": []}},
      {"Exercise Schedule": {"type": "schedule"}},
      {"Frequency": {"type": "options", "options": []}}
    ]
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it was marked as not required, and also removed any unnecessary information to provide a clean output.
