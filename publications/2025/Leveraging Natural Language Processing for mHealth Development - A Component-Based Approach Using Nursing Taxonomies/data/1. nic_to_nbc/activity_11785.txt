Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Informational Support": {
    "parameters": [
      {"informational_needs": "A parameter that specifies the informational needs of the parents, family, educators, and caretakers (e.g., how to teach child, anticipatory guidance, developmental considerations)"},
      {"support_type": "A parameter that specifies the type of support to be provided (e.g., educational resources, counseling, referrals)"},
      {"frequency": "A parameter that specifies how often the informational support task should be repeated"},
      {"deadline_date": "A parameter that specifies the due date for the informational support task"}
    ]
  }
}


I removed all non-parameter elements and kept only the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the `notes` parameter as it's not applicable. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
