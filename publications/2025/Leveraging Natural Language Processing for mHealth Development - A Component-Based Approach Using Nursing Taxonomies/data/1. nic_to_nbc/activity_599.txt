Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Humor Therapy": {
        "Parameters": {
            "Humor Style": {},
            "Humor Topics": {},
            "Joke Library": {},
            "Create Your Own": {},
            "Frequency": {}
        }
    }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters (`Deadline Date`) and kept only the required ones. Let me know if this meets your requirements!
