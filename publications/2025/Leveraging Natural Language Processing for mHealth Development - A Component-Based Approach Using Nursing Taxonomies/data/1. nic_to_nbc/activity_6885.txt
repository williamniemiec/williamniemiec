Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "elementName": "Financial Resources Assessment",
  "parameters": {
    "Insurance Coverage": {
      "description": "Do you have insurance coverage for specialty foot care services?",
      "required": true,
      "type": "options",
      "options": [
        { "value": "yes", "label": "Yes" },
        { "value": "no", "label": "No" }
      ]
    },
    "Insurance Provider": {
      "description": "Who is your insurance provider?",
      "required": false,
      "type": "text"
    },
    "Out-of-Pocket Expenses": {
      "description": "How much are you able to pay out-of-pocket for specialty foot care services?",

    },
    "Financial Assistance Programs": {
      "description": "Are you eligible for financial assistance programs?",
      "required": true,
      "type": "options",

        { "value": "no", "label": "No" }
      ]
    }
  }
}


I removed the "Additional Financial Resources" parameter since it was not applicable (required=false). Let me know if you need any further assistance!
