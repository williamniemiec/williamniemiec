Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Trust Building": {
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "name"},
      {"name": "communication style"},
      {"name": "active listening"},
      {"name": "empathy expression"},
      {"name": "reliability demonstration"},
      {"name": "vulnerability sharing"},
      {"name": "feedback solicitation"}
    ]
  }
}


Note that I removed the `deadline_date` parameter as it was marked as not required (`"required": false`). Let me know if you need any further assistance!
