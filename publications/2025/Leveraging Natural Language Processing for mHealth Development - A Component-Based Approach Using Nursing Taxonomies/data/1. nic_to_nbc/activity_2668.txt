Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Referral Form": {
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "referral_type", "description": "Type of referral"},
      {"name": "referral_reason", "description": "Reason for referral"},
      {"name": "patient_info", "description": "Patient information"},
      {"name": "provider_info", "description": "Referring provider information"},
      {"name": "notes", "description": "Additional notes or comments about the referral"}
    ]
  }
}


Note that I removed the `required` and `type` fields as they were not requested in the output. If you need them, let me know!
