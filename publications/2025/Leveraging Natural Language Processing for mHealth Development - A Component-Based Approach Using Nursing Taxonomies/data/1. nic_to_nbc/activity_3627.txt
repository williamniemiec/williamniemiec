Here is the output in JSON format:



{
    "Community Resource Directory": {
        "Agency Categories": {"Type": "list of categories"},
        "Agency List": {"Type": "list of agencies"},
        "Filtering Criteria": {"Type": "list of filtering options"},
        "Rating and Review": {"Type": "rating system and review text input"}
    }
}


Note that I removed the "Referral Process" parameter as it's not applicable, and also removed any unnecessary information to provide a clean JSON output.
