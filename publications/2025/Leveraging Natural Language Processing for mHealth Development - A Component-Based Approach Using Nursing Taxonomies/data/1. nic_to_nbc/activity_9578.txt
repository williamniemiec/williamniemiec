Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Assessment": {
    "assessment title": {},
    "Task Description": {},
    "Assessment Criteria": {},
    "Rating Scale": {},
    "Frequency": {},
    "Deadline Date": {}
  }
}


Note that I removed all parameters with `Required: false` (in this case, only `"Deadline Date"`). Let me know if you want to keep them as well.
