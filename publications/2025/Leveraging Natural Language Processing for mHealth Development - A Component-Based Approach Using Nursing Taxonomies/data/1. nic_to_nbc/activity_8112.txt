Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Awareness Module": {
    "Topic": {},
    "Content": {},
    "Reflection Questions": {},
    "Resources": {}
  }
}


I removed the parameters that are not applicable (i.e., `Discussion Forum` and `Quiz or Assessment` which have boolean types, and `Frequency` which has options). Let me know if you need anything else!
