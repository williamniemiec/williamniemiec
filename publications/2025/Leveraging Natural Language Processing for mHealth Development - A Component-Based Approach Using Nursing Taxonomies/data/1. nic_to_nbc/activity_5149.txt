Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Conflict Resolution": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Conflict Description": {"Type": "text", "Required": true},
      "Feelings and Needs": {"Type": "list of text", "Required": true},
      "Resolution Strategies": {"Type": "list of text", "Required": true},
      "Reflection Prompt": {"Type": "text", "Required": true}
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Caregiver Support` and `Frequency` parameters as they have options, which are not applicable in this case. Let me know if you need anything else!
