Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Oxygen Therapy": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "",
      "instructions": "",
      "flow_rate": "",
      "duration": "",
      "frequency": "",
      "saturation_level": ""
    }
  }
}


I removed all unnecessary text and kept only the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the "deadline_date" and "notes" parameters as they were not applicable. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
