Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Swabbing Technique Guidance": {
    "parameters": {
      "Swabbing Instructions": {"type": "text"},
      "Swabbing Demonstration": {"type": "multimedia"},
      "Gentle Pressure Confirmation": {"type": "boolean"},
      "Perpendicular Swabbing Confirmation": {"type": "boolean"},
      "Frequency": {"options": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"]},
      "Deadline Date": {"type": "datetime"}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Confirmation` parameter as it seems to be a redundant boolean confirmation, and also removed the introduction and conclusion sections, as per your request. Let me know if you need anything else!
