Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Parent Support Group Referral": {
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "Support Group Types", "type": "list of support group types"},
      {"name": "Support Group List", "type": "list of support groups"},
      {"name": "Referral Criteria", "type": "referral rules"},
      {"name": "Resource Materials", "type": "list of resource materials"},
      {"name": "Frequency", "type": "options"}
    ]
  }
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it's marked as not required. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
