Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Weight Monitoring Task": [
    { 
      "name": "Name", 
      "description": "A parameter that specifies the title or name of the weight monitoring task."
    },
    { 
      "name": "Frequency", 
      "description": "A parameter that specifies how often to weigh themselves.",
      "unit": "days or weeks"
    },
    { 
      "name": "Unit", 
      "description": "A parameter that specifies the unit of weight measurement.",
      "options": [
        { value: "kg" },
        { value: "lbs" },
        { value: "stones" }
      ]
    },
    { 
      "name": "Goal Weight", 
      "description": "A parameter that specifies the goal weight to achieve.",
      "unit": "kg or lbs"
    },
    { 
      "name": "Instructions", 
      "description": "A parameter that provides instructions on how to weigh themselves accurately and what to do if experiencing any changes in weight."
    },
    { 
      "name": "Tracking", 
      "description": "A parameter that asks the patient to track their weight over time and report any changes to their healthcare provider."
    }
  ]
}

I removed all unnecessary parts from the input text, keeping only the no-code element name and its parameters. I also reformatted the output in a JSON structure for easier readability.
