Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Pulse Monitor": {
    "parameters": [
      {"Bleeding Site": {}},
      {"Pulse Location": {}},
      {"Pulse Rate": {}},
      {"Pulse Character": {}},
      {"Frequency": {}}
    ]
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it was marked as not required. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
