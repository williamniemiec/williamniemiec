Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "High Fiber Food Guide": {
    "Parameters": {
      "High Fiber Foods": {
        "Description": "List of foods high in fiber",
        "Required": true,
        "Type": "List of food items",
        "Food Items": [
          "Fruits: apples, bananas, berries",
          "Vegetables: broccoli, carrots, Brussels sprouts",
          "Legumes: beans, lentils, peas",
          "Whole Grains: brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat bread"
        ]
      },
      "Frequency": {
        "Description": "Specify how often to review high fiber food guide",
        "Required": true,
        "Type": "Options",
        "Options": [
          { "value": "daily", "label": "Daily" },
          { "value": "everyOtherDay", "label": "Every other day" },
          { "value": "weekly", "label": "Weekly" }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` and `Notes` parameters since they are not applicable (i.e., their `Required` field is set to `false`). Let me know if you need anything else!
