Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Personal Interests": {
    "Hobbies and Interests": {
      "Description": "List your individual hobbies and outside interests",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "list"
    },
    "Goal Setting": {
      "Description": "Set specific, measurable, and achievable goals for pursuing your hobbies and interests",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "goal setting template"
    },
    "Schedule": {
      "Description": "Schedule time for pursuing your hobbies and interests",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "calendar or scheduling tool"
    }
  }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters (`Reminders` and `Reflection`) since they are marked as `false` in the `Required` field. Let me know if you need anything else!
