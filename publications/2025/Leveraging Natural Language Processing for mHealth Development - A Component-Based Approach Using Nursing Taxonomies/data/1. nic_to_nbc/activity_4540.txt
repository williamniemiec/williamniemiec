Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Belief Assessment": {
    "parameters": {
      "Question": {"type": "text"},
      "Answer Type": {"type": "options", "options": ["text", "multiple choice", "rating scale (e.g., 1-5)"]},
      "Issue": {"type": "text"},
      "Frequency": {"type": "options", "options": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"]}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it was not applicable (i.e., there was no corresponding value in the input text). Let me know if this is correct!
