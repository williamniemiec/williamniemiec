Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Toilet Hygiene Guide": {
        "Parameters": {
            "Name": {"Type": "text"},
            "Content": {"Type": "text or multimedia"},
            "Steps": {"Type": "ordered list of text or multimedia"},
            "Frequency": {"Options": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"]},
            "Deadline Date": {"Type": "datetime"}
        }
    }
}


Note that I removed the `Task` no-code element and its parameters as they were mentioned as an alternative, but not part of the main suggestion. Let me know if you'd like me to include it as well!
