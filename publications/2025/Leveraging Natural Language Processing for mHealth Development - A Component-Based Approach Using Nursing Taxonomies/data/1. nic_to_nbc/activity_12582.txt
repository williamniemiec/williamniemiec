Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "toileting schedule": {
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "toileting method", "description": "specify the toileting method (commode at bedside or bedpan)"},
      {"name": "schedule frequency", "description": "specify how often toileting should be scheduled"},
      {"name": "schedule timing", "description": "specify the timing of toileting (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening)"}
    ]
  }
}


I removed the `deadline_date` parameter since it's not applicable (i.e., its `"required"` field is set to `false`). Let me know if you have any further questions!
