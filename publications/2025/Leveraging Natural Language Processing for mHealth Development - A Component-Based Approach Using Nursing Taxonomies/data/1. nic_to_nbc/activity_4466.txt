Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Social Connection": {
    "Interest": {"type": "text"},
    "Goal": {"type": "text"},
    "Frequency": {"type": "options", "options": ["daily", "weekly", "monthly", "quarterly"]},
    "Resources": {"type": "text or link"}
  }
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it's not applicable (no code element is not bound to a specific date). Let me know if you need any further modifications!
