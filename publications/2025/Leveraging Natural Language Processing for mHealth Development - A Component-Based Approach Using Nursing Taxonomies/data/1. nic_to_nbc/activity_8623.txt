Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Accreditation Guide": {
        "Parameters": {
            "Accreditation Types": {
                "Type": "list of accreditation types"
            },
            "State Health Department Requirements": {
                "Type": "list of state health department requirements"
            }
        }
    },
    "Facility Accreditation Checker": {
        "Parameters": {
            "Facility Search": {
                "Type": "facility search"
            },
            "Accreditation Status": {
                "Type": "accreditation status"
            }
        }
    },
    "Quality Metrics": {
        "Parameters": {
            "Quality Metrics": {
                "Type": "list of quality metrics"
            },
            "Facility Ratings": {
                "Type": "facility ratings"
            }
        }
    }
}


Note that I removed the introduction and conclusion parts, as well as the numbering and descriptions of the no-code elements. I also kept only the parameter specifications, removing any non-applicable parameters. The output is in JSON format, with each no-code element having its own object containing the parameter specifications.
