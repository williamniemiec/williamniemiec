Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Dietary Guidance": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Electrolyte Imbalance": {"Type": "text"},
      "Dietary Recommendations": {"Type": "list of text or HTML content"},
      "Food Categories": {"Options": ["potassium-rich foods", "low-sodium foods"]},
      "Meal Planning": {"Type": "text or HTML content"}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the "Tracking" parameter as it was marked as "See" which I assumed means "Not Applicable". Let me know if that's incorrect.
