Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Culturally Sensitive Self-Care": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Cultural Background": {
        "Type": "text or options",
        "Required": true
      },
      "Self-Care Activities": {
        "Type": "list of text or links",
        "Required": true
      }
    }
  }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters (i.e., "Customization" since it's not required) and kept only the necessary information.
