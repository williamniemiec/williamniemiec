Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "name",
      "type": "text"
    },
    {
      "name": "steps",
      "type": "list"
    },
    {
      "name": "condition",
      "type": "text"
    },
    {
      "name": "duration",
      "type": "text"
    },
    {
      "name": "frequency",
      "type": "options"
    }
  ]
}


Note that I removed the `description` and other unnecessary fields, as well as the `image` parameter which was not applicable. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
