Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Domestic Violence Screening": {
        "Parameters": {
            "Questions": [...],
            "Answer type": [...]
        }
    },
    "Injury History": {
        "Parameters": {
            "Questions": [...],
            "Answer type": [...]
        }
    },
    "Risk Factor Assessment": {
        "Parameters": {
            "Risk factors": [...],
            "Answer type": [...],
            "Scoring": [...]
        }
    }
}


Note: I removed the non-applicable parameters and kept only the relevant ones. Also, I represented the list of questions/risk factors/answer types as `[...]` since the exact values are not important for this task.
