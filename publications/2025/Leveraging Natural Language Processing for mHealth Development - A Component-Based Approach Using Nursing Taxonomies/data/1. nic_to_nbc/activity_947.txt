Here is the output in JSON format:

{
  "Family Engagement Activity": {
    "Activity Type": {"type": "options"},
    "Activity Description": {"type": "text"},
    "Family Members": {"type": "list of names or email addresses"},
    "Schedule": {"type": "date and time picker"},
    "Reminders": {"type": "boolean"},
    "Reflection Questions": {"type": "list of questions"}
  }
}

Note that I removed the not applicable parameters and only kept the ones with specifications.
