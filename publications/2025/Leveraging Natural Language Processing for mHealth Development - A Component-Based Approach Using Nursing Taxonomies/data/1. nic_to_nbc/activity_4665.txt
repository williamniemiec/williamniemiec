Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Postprocedure Monitoring": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": {"description": "title of the postprocedure monitoring instructions", "required": true, "type": "text"},
      "vital_signs": {"description": "tracking of vital signs such as temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate", "required": true, "type": "vital_signs"},
      "symptom_reporting": {"description": "reporting of symptoms such as pain, bleeding, or swelling", "required": true, "type": "symptom_reporting"},
      "messaging": {"description": "secure messaging with healthcare team for questions or concerns", "required": true, "type": "messaging"}
    }
  }
}


I removed the non-applicable parameters (photo_upload and deadline_date) as they are not required.
