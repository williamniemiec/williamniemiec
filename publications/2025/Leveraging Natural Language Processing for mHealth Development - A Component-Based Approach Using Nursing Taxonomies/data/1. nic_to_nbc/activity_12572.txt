Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Shoe Assessment Checklist": {
        "name": "Shoe Appropriateness Checklist",
        "description": "Please assess your shoes based on the following criteria",
        "content_type": "checklist",
        "items": [
            "Low-heeled",
            "Shoe shape matches foot shape",
            "Adequate depth of toe box",
            "Soles made of shock-absorbing material",
            "Adjustable fit by lace or straps",
            "Uppers made of breathable, soft, and flexible materials",
            "Changes made for gait and limb length disorders",
            "Potential for modification, if necessary"
        ],
        "answer_type": ["boolean", "select"],
        "frequency": null,
        "deadline_date": null,
        "notes": null
    }
}


I removed all the unnecessary text and only kept the `PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS` section. I also converted it to JSON format as requested. Note that I set `frequency`, `deadline_date`, and `notes` to `null` since they were not applicable parameters in this case.
