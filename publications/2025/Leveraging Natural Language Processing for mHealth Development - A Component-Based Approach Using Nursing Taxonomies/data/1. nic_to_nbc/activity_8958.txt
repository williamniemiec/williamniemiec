Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Lab Test Tracker": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {},
      "Electrolytes to Monitor": {},
      "Frequency of Testing": {},
      "Normal Ranges": {},
      "Result Tracking": {},
      "Alerts and Notifications": {},
      "Deadline Date": {}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the "Resources" parameter as it's not applicable. Also, I didn't include the types of parameters in the output as per your request.
