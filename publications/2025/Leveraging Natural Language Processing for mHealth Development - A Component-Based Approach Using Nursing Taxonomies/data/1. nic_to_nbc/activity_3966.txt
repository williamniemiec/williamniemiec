Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Hair Care Instructions": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Hair Care Topic": {},
      "Instructional Content": {},
      "Patient or Parent": {}
    }
  }
}


I removed all the unnecessary information and kept only the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the "Additional Resources" parameter since it's not required. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
