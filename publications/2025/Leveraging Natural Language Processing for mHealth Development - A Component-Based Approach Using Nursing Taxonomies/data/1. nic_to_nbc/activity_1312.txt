Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Breast Inspection Position Guide": {
    "Position Instructions": {},
    "Position Images": {},
    "Position Checklist": {},
    "Image Capture": {}
  }
}


I removed the parameters that are not applicable (`Frequency` and `Deadline Date`) as per your instructions. Let me know if you have any further requests!
