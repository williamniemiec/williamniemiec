Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Quit Smoking Method Selector": {
    "parameters": {
      "Quit Methods": {"type": "options", "options": ["Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)", "Prescription medications", "Counseling or support groups", "Cold turkey", "Other"]},
      "Reasons for Quitting": {"type": "text"},
      "Quit Date": {"type": "datetime"}
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Additional Resources` parameter since it's a boolean type and doesn't seem to be applicable in this context. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
