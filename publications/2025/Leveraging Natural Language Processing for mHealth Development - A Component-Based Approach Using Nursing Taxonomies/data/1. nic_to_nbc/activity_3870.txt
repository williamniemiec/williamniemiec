Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Hemodynamic Response Tracker": {
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "Blood Pressure", "type": "number", "unit": "mmHg"},
      {"name": "Heart Rate", "type": "number", "unit": "beats per minute"},
      {"name": "Oxygen Saturation", "type": "number", "unit": "%"}
    ]
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Fluid Status` parameter since it had a lot of unnecessary characters and no clear type or unit. If you want to include it, please let me know how you'd like it formatted.
