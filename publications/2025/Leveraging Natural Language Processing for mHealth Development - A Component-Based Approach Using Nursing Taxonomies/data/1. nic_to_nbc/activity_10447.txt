Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Guide": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Food Categories": {"type": "list of options"},
      "Food Examples": {"type": "list of text or images"},
      "Meal Planning Tips": {"type": "list of text or HTML"},
      "Portion Control Guidance": {"type": "text or HTML"}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Frequency` parameter as it was marked as "Not Applicable" (i.e., it didn't have a specific value). Let me know if you need any further assistance!
