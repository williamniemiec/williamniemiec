Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "symptom name": {
    "Description": "name of the symptom to monitor",
    "Required": true,
    "Type": "text"
  },
  "Questions": {
    "Description": "questions to ask the patient about cerumen accumulation",
    "Required": true,
    "Type": "list of questions with options"
  },
  "Frequency": {
    "Description": "specify how often the patient should monitor for cerumen accumulation",
    "Required": true,
    "Type": "options",
    "Options": ["daily", "weekly", "monthly", "asNeeded"]
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it's marked as not required (`false`).
