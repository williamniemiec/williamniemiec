Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Guide": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "Child Development and Child Rearing Guide",
      "pages": "",
      "frequency": "onlyOnce"
    }
  },
  "Question": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "Child Development and Child Rearing Questionnaire",
      "questions": "",
      "answer type": "",
      "resources": "",
      "frequency": "onlyOnce"
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the `deadline_date` parameter since it was specified as "not required" in the input text. I also didn't include the `pages` and `questions` parameters with values, assuming they are not applicable without specific content.
