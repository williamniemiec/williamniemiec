Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Progress Evaluation": {
    "Movement Function": {"Description": "Select the body movement and function to evaluate", "Required": true, "Type": "options"},
    "Progress Rating": {"Description": "Rate your progress toward enhancement/restoration of body movement and function", "Required": true, "Type": "options"},
    "Goal Achievement": {"Description": "Have you achieved your goals for body movement and function?", "Required": true, "Type": "options"}
  }
}


I removed the introduction, conclusion, and non-parameter elements, as well as the parameters that were marked as not applicable (i.e., "Challenges" and "Next Steps"). Let me know if this meets your requirements!
