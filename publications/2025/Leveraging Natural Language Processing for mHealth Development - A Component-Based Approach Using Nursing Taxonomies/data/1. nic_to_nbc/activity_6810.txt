Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Vital Sign Tracking": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "",
      "vital_signs": [],
      "frequency": "",
      "reporting_type": ""
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `deadline_date` parameter as it was not applicable in this context. Let me know if you have any further questions!
