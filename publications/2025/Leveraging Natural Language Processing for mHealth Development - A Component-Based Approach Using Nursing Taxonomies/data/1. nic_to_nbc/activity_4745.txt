Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Breathing Instruction": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Breathing Instruction": {},
      "Breathing Technique": {},
      "Duration": {},
      "Frequency": {}
    }
  }
}


I removed all unnecessary information and only kept the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the not applicable parameters, which in this case was the `"Deadline Date"` parameter since it's not required.
