Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Symptom Monitoring": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Symptoms": {},
      "Frequency": {},
      "Deadline Date": {},
      "Notes": {}
    }
  }
}


I removed the "Outpatient Contact" parameter as it was marked as a boolean type with options yes/no, which is not applicable in this context. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
