Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Therapy Goal Progress Tracker": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Therapy Goals": {
        "Type": "list of text"
      },
      "Current Progress": {
        "Type": "rating scale (e.g., 1-5)"
      },
      "Goal Achievement": {
        "Type": "checkbox list"
      },
      "Challenges and Barriers": {
        "Type": "text"
      },
      "Action Plan": {
        "Type": "text"
      }
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Next Steps` parameter as it was not applicable (the text was cut off). Let me know if you need anything else!
