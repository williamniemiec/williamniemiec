Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Nutrition Assessment": {
    "parameters": {
      "Dietary Intake": {"type": "text or list of food items"},
      "Nutrient Analysis": {"type": "algorithm or calculation"},
      "Nutrient Deficiencies": {"type": "list of nutrients"},
      "Personalized Recommendations": {"type": "text or list of food items"}
    }
  }
}


I removed the "Additional Resources" parameter as it's not applicable to the no-code element. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
