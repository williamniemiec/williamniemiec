Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "name": "Electrode Application",
    "parameters": [
        { 
            "name": "Electrode Type", 
        },
        { 
            "name": "Application Site", 
        },
        { 
            "name": "Skin Preparation", 
        },
        { 
            "name": "Electrode Placement", 
        },
        { 
            "name": "Additional Instructions", 
        }
    ]
}


I removed everything except the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`, and formatted it as a JSON object. I also removed the "not applicable" parameters, which in this case were none. Let me know if you need anything else!
