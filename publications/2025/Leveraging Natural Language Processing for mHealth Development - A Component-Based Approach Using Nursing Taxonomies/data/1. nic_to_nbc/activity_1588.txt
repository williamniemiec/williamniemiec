Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Oral Health Tracker": {
    "tracker title": {},
    "Oral Symptoms": {},
    "Mucous Membrane Appearance": {},
    "Frequency": {}
  }
}


I removed all unnecessary information and only kept the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also removed the "Notes" parameter since it's not applicable (Required: false). Let me know if you need any further assistance!
