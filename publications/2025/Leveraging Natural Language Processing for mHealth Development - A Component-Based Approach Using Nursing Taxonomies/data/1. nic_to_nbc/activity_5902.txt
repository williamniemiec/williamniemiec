Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Equipment Disposal": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Disposal Instructions": {},
      "Equipment Type": {},
      "Disposal Method": {},
      "Frequency": {}
    }
  }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters (`Deadline Date`) and kept only the required ones. Let me know if this is what you were expecting!
