Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "abnormal sign reporting": {
        "Reporting Instructions": {"type": "text"},
        "Symptom List": {"type": "list of text"},
        "Severity Scale": {"type": "scale (e.g. 1-5)"},
        "Additional Notes": {"type": "text"}
    }
}


Note: I removed the `Physician Contact Information` parameter as it's not applicable in this context, and also removed any unnecessary information to provide a clean JSON output.
