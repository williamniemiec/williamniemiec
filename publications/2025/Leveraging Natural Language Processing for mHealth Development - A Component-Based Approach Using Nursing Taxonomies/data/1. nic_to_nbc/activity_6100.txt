Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Discipline Reflection": {
        "Prompt": {},
        "Reflection Type": {},
        "Discipline Experiences": {},
        "Emotional Response": {},
        "Influence on Parenting": {}
    }
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it's not applicable in a no-code element. Let me know if you have any further questions!
