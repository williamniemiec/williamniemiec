Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Care Arrangement Assessment": {
        "Caregiver Abilities": {},
        "Caregiver Characteristics": {},
        "Competing Responsibilities": {},
        "Environmental Accommodations": {},
        "Relationship History": {},
        "Care Needs Consideration": {},
        "Duress": {}
    }
}


Note that I removed the parameter specifications and only kept the no-code element name and its parameters.
