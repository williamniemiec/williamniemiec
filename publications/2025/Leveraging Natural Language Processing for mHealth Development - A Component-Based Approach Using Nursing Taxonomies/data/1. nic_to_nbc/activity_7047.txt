Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "Injury Type",
      "type": "options",
      "options": ["fireAndElectricalBurns", "suffocationAndAspiration", "poisoning", "falls", "bodilyInjury", "drowning", "motorVehicleInjury"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Prevention Strategies",
      "type": "list"
    }
  ],
  "elementName": "Injury Prevention Strategies"
}


Note that I removed the `Resources` parameter since it was not applicable, and also removed the descriptions and other unnecessary fields to simplify the output. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
