Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Sibling Involvement": {
    "parameters": {
      "Sibling Roles": {"type": "list of options or text"},
      "Activity Ideas": {"type": "list of options or links to resources"},
      "Goal Setting": {"type": "text or checklist"},
      "Task Assignment": {"type": "task list or schedule"},
      "Progress Tracking": {"type": "journal or log"}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Reminders and Notifications` parameter because its type is a boolean (yes/no) or frequency, which doesn't provide any specific information about the element.
