Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Schedule Exercise": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {},
      "Description": {},
      "Exercise Days": {},
      "Exercise Time": {},
      "Duration": {},
      "Frequency": {},
      "Reminders": {},
      "Reminder Time": {},
      "Calendar Integration": {}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the not applicable parameters and only kept the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. Let me know if this is what you were expecting!
