Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Information Resource": {
    "parameters": [
      {
        "name": "legislation_info",
        "description": "Text or PDF describing the legislation and eligibility criteria",
        "required": true,
        "type": "text" or "pdf"
      },
      {
        "name": "leave_details",
        "description": "Details about the 12 weeks unpaid leave of absence",
        "required": true,
        "type": "text"
      },
      {
        "name": "eligibility_criteria",
        "description": "Eligibility criteria for the unpaid leave of absence",
        "required": true,
        "type": "text"
      }
    ]
  }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters, such as `resources` which had a `required` value of `false`. Let me know if this is what you were expecting!
