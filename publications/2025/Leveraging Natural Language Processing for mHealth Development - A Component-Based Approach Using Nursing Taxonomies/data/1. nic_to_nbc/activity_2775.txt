Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Multimodal Teaching": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Teaching Objectives": {
        "Type": "list of objectives"
      },
      "Teaching Modalities": {
        "Type": "list of modalities"
      },
      "Modality Selection Criteria": {
        "Type": "object",
        "Properties": {
          "Learning Style": {
            "Type": "options"
          },
          "Content Complexity": {
            "Type": "options"
          },
          "Patient Preferences": {
            "Type": "options"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}


I removed all the unnecessary text and only kept the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}` parts, formatted as a JSON object. I also removed any non-applicable parameters. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
