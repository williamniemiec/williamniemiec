Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Intake-Output Tracker": {
        "Name": {"Type": "text"},
        "Intake Units": {"Type": "options"},
        "Output Units": {"Type": "options"},
        "Frequency": {"Type": "options"},
        "Input Fields": {"Type": "form"}
    }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it is not applicable in this context, and also removed any unnecessary text or formatting. Let me know if you need anything else!
