Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "guide": {
    "parameters": {
      "Name": "Pushing Techniques for Second Stage Labor",
      "Pages": [
        "Breathing techniques for pushing",
        "Proper body positioning for pushing",
        "Pushing with contractions"
      ],
      "Frequency": "One-time, during second stage labor"
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the "Deadline Date" parameter since it's marked as "Not required", which I assume means it's not applicable.
