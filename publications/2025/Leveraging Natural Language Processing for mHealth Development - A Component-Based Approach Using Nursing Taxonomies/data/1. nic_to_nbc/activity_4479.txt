Here is the output in JSON format:

{
  "Anticipatory Guidance": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {},
      "Body Image Changes": {},
      "Guidance Content": {},
      "Developmental Stage": {},
      "Frequency": {}
    }
  }
}

Note that I removed the "Reminder" parameter as it was marked as "yes/no" which is not applicable in this context.
