Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Wound Packing Instruction": {
    "Name": {},
    "Dressing Type": {},
    "Packing Instructions": {},
    "Photos or Videos": {},
    "Frequency": {}
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it's not applicable in this context. Let me know if you have any further questions!
