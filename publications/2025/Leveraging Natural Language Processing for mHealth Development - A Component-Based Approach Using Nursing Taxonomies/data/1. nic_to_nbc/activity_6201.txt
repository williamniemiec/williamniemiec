Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Lab Result Tracker": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Lab Test": {},
      "Result": {},
      "Unit": {},
      "Frequency": {},
      "Deadline Date": {}
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Notes` parameter as it's not applicable in this context. Let me know if you have any further questions!
