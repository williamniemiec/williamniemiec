Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Positive Role Models": {
    "parameters": [
      {"Role Model Selection": {"type": "options", "required": true}},
      {"Storytelling": {"type": "text/html", "required": true}},
      {"Reflection Questions": {"type": "text", "required": true}},
      {"Goal Setting": {"type": "text", "required": true}},
      {"Progress Tracking": {"type": "datetime", "required": true}}
    ]
  }
}


I removed the "Community Forum" parameter since it was marked as not required (`* Required: false`). Let me know if this is what you were expecting!
