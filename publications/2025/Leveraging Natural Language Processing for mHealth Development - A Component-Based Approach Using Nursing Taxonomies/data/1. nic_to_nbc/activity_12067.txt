Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Patient Space Allocation": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Patient Type": {},
      "CDC Guidelines": {},
      "Room Dimensions": {},
      "Calculation": {}
    }
  }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters, such as `Notes`, and kept only the required parameters. Let me know if this is what you were expecting!
