Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Product Selection": {
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "Product List", "description": "A list of products to be evaluated, including their names, descriptions, and images."},
      {"name": "Selection Type", "description": "A parameter that specifies whether the patient can select one or multiple products."},
      {"name": "Evaluation Criteria", "description": "A list of criteria to be used for evaluating the selected products."},
      {"name": "Frequency", "description": "A parameter that specifies how often the product selection should be repeated."},
    ]
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it's not applicable (required:false). Let me know if you have any further questions!
