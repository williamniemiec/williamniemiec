Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "name": "diarrhea-causing food avoidance",
  "parameters": [
    { 
      "name": "food avoidance list", 
      "description": "list of foods to avoid that can cause diarrhea", 
      "required": true, 
      "type": "text"
    },
    { 
      "name": "frequency", 
      "description": "specify how often to review and update the food avoidance list", 
      "required": true, 
      "type": "options",
      "options": [
        { value: "daily", label: "Daily" },
        { value: "everyHours", label: "Every x hours" },
        { value: "everyDays", label: "Every x days" },
      ]
    }
  ]
}


I removed all the non-applicable parameters, keeping only the `name` and `parameters` that are required. Let me know if this is what you were expecting!
