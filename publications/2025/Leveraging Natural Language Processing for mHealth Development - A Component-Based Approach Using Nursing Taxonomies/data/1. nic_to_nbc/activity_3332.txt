Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Pain Information": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "",
      "content": "",
      "sections": []
    }
  },
  "Procedure Information": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "",
      "procedure_name": "",
      "description": "",
      "discomforts": []
    }
  },
  "FAQs": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "",
      "questions": []
    }
  },
  "Resource Library": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "",
      "resources": []
    }
  }
}

Note that I removed the "INTRODUCTION" and "CONCLUSION" sections, as well as the numbering and descriptions of the no-code elements. I also removed any parameters that were not applicable (i.e., empty or not specified). The resulting JSON object has each no-code element name as a key, with its corresponding parameter specifications as values.
