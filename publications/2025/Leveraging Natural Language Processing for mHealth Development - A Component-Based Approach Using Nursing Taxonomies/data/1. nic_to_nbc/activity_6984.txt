Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Open-Ended Question": {
    "parameters": {
      "name": "birth experience and newborn concerns",
      "description": "Share your thoughts, questions, or concerns about your birth experience and newborn",
      "content_type": "text",
      "answer_type": "free_text"
    }
  }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters (frequency and deadline_date) as they were marked as optional. Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
