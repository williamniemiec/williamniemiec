Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Immobilization Guide": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Device to Use": {
        "Type": "options",
        "Options": ["cervical collar", "backboard", "other"]
      },
      "Technique to Use": {
        "Type": "options",
        "Options": ["move patient as a unit", "transport patient in supine position", "other"]
      },
      "Instructions": {
        "Type": "text"
      },
      "Frequency of Immobilization": {
        "Type": "options",
        "Options": ["continuously", "as needed", "other"]
      },
      "Duration of Immobilization": {
        "Type": "text"
      }
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` and `Notes` parameters as they are not applicable (datetime and text fields respectively). Let me know if you have any further questions!
