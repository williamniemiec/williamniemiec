Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Shoe Inspection": {
    "name": "Shoe Inspection",
    "description": "Inspect your shoes for proper fit",
    "questions": [
      "Do your shoes fit comfortably?",
      "Are your shoes too tight or too loose?",
      "Do you have any pressure points or discomfort?"
    ],
    "answer type": ["Yes", "No", "Not sure"],
    "frequency": "",
    "deadline_date": ""
  }
}


Note: I removed the "Content type" parameter as it's not part of the `PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS` section. Also, I left the "frequency" and "deadline_date" parameters empty as they didn't have specific values in the input text. If you want to remove them entirely since they're not applicable, let me know!
