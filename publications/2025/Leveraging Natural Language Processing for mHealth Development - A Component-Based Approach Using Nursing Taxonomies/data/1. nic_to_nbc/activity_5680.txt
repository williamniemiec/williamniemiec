Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "name": "Fit Monitoring",
    "parameters": [
        {
            "name": "devices_to_monitor"
        },
        {
            "name": "monitoring_frequency"
        },
        {
            "name": "fit_criteria"
        },
        {
            "name": "reporting_instructions"
        }
    ]
}


I removed the not applicable parameters (i.e., `deadline_date` since it's not required) and only kept the `name` and `parameters` fields. Let me know if this is what you were expecting!
