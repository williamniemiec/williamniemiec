Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Continence Diary": {
    "Diary Title": {},
    "Entries": {},
    "Frequency": {},
    "Review": {}
  }
}


I removed all unnecessary information, keeping only the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also excluded the parameters that were marked as "Not Applicable" or had a "Required" value of false. Let me know if this meets your requirements!
