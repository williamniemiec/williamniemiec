Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Resource Explorer": {
    "parameters": {
      "Resource Categories": {},
      "Resource Options": {},
      "Filtering Criteria": {},
      "Action Plan": {}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Resource Rating` parameter as it was marked as "not applicable" (it had a rating system type, but no specific values or options were provided). Let me know if you'd like me to clarify anything!
