Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "ICP and CPP Monitoring": {
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "ICP", "type": "number"},
      {"name": "CPP", "type": "number"},
      {"name": "Frequency", "type": "options", "options": ["daily", "onlyOnce", "everyHours", "everyDays"]},
      {"name": "Deadline Date", "type": "datetime"}
    ]
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Description` and `Required` fields as they were not specified to be included in the output. Let me know if you need those fields as well!
