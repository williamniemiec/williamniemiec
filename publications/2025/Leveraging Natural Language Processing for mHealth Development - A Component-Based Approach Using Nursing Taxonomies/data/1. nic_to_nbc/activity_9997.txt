Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Enteral Feeding Storage": {
    "Container Status": {
      "description": "Indicate if the container is open or closed",
      "required": true,
      "type": "options",
      "options": [
        { "value": "open", "label": "Open" },
        { "value": "closed", "label": "Closed" }
      ]
    },
    "Refrigeration Status": {
      "description": "Indicate if the open container is refrigerated",
      "required": true,
      "type": "boolean"
    },
    "Storage Time": {
      "description": "Record the time the container was stored in the refrigerator",
      "required": true,
      "type": "datetime"
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the "Notes" parameter since it's not required. Let me know if you'd like me to include it anyway!
