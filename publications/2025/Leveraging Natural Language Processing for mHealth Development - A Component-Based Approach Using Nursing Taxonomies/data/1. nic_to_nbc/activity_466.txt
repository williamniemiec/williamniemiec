Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Cue Recognition": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Cue Types": {
        "Description": "list of infant cues, such as hunger, tiredness, and overstimulation",
        "Required": true,
        "Type": "list of text and images"
      },
      "State Identification": {
        "Description": "identify infant states, such as awake, asleep, and fussy",
        "Required": true,
        "Type": "list of text and images"
      },
      "Video Examples": {
        "Description": "video examples of infant cues and states, such as a hungry infant or a tired infant",
        "Required": true,
        "Type": "list of videos"
      }
    }
  }
}


I removed the non-required parameters (`Quizzes` and `Tips and Reminders`) from the output. Let me know if this meets your requirements!
