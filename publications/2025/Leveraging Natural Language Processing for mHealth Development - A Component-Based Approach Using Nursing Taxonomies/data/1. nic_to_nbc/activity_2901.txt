Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Object Placement Guide": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Object Type": {},
      "Frequency of Use": {},
      "Reach Zone": {},
      "Image/Video": {}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Tips for Organization` parameter as it was marked as "Not Applicable" since it didn't have a specific type (options, text, etc.)
