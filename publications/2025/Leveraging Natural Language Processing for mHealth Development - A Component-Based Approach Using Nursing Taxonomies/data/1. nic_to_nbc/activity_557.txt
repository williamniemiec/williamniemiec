Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Communication Cue": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {"Type": "text"},
      "Shoulder Side": {"Type": "options", "Options": ["left", "right"]},
      "Conversation Type": {"Type": "options"},
      "Alert Message": {"Type": "text"},
      "Frequency": {"Type": "options", "Options": ["daily", "every few hours", "as needed"]}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it is not applicable (datetime type). Also, I didn't include the `Conversation Type` options list as it was not provided in the input.
