Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Flavor Enhancement Guide": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Name": {"Type": "text"},
      "Herbs and Spices List": {"Type": "list of herbs and spices"},
      "Recipe Suggestions": {"Type": "list of recipe suggestions"},
      "Flavor Profiling": {"Type": "list of flavor profiling data"}
    }
  }
}


I removed the following:

* The introduction and conclusion sections
* The "Salt Reduction Tips" and "Resources" parameters, as they are not applicable to the no-code element.
* The explanatory text and formatting (bold, italic, etc.)
