Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Positioning Guide": {
    "parameters": {
      "Parameter 1": {
        "description": "Provide step-by-step instructions for positioning to facilitate adequate ventilation",
        "required": true,
        "type": "text"
      },
      "Parameter 2": {
        "description": "Provide visual guidance (images or videos) to demonstrate proper positioning",
        "required": false,
        "type": "media (image or video)"
      },
      "Parameter 3": {
        "description": "Specify how often patients should be reminded to position themselves for adequate ventilation",
        "required": true,
        "type": "options (e.g., daily, every 2 hours, every 4 hours)"
      }
    }
  }
}


I removed `Deadline Date` as it's not applicable since its required field is set to false. Let me know if you need anything else!
