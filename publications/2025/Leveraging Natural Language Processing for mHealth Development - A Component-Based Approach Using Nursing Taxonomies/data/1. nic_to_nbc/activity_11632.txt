        "content": "text or audio message explaining the call process",
        "Content Type": "text or audio"
    },
    "Consent": {
        "consent_text": "text explaining the purpose and scope of the call",
        "consent_type": "type of consent (e.g., verbal, written)",
        "consent_response": "patient's response to the consent request (e.g., yes, no)",
