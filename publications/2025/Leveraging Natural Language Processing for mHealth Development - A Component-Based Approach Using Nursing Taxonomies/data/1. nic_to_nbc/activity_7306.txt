Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Wire Inspection": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Wire Condition": {},
      "Wear Signs": {},
      "Replacement Needed": {}
    }
  }
}


I removed all unnecessary information and only kept the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`. I also excluded the `"Replacement Instructions"` parameter since it's marked as not required.
