Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS": [
    "* Identify potential signs of underreaction or overreaction, such as inconsistencies in the adult's behavior or unusual emotional responses.",
    "* Evaluate the adult's emotional regulation and coping mechanisms, including factors such as tone, body language, and verbal responses.",
    "* Make a professional judgment about the appropriateness of the adult's reactions and the potential risks to the child or others."
  ],
  "NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME": null
}


Note: Since there is no specific no-code element name mentioned in the input text, I have set it to `null` in the output JSON.
