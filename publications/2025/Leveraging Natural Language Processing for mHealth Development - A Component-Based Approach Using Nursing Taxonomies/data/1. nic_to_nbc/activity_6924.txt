Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Comfort Level Assessment": {
    "parameters": {
      "Comfort Level": {"type": "numeric"},
      "Comfort Description": {"type": "options", "options": [{"value": "veryComfortable", "label": "Very comfortable"}, {"value": "somewhatComfortable", "label": "Somewhat comfortable"}, {"value": "uncomfortable", "label": "Uncomfortable"}]},
      "Frequency": {"type": "options", "options": [{"value": "daily", "label": "Daily"}, {"value": "everyHours", "label": "Every x hours"}, {"value": "everyDays", "label": "Every x days"}]}
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it was marked as not applicable. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
