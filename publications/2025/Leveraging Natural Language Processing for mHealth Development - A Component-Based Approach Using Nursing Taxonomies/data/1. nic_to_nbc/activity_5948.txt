Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Family Involvement": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Family Member": {
        "Type": "family member demographics and contact information",
        "Required": true
      },
      "Involvement Type": {
        "Type": "options (list of involvement types)",
        "Required": true
      },
      "Care Plan": {
        "Type": "care plan document",
        "Required": true
      },
      "Communication Method": {
        "Type": "options (list of communication methods)",
        "Required": true
      },
      "Frequency of Involvement": {
        "Type": "options (list of frequencies)",
        "Required": true
      }
    }
  }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters, such as `Progress Updates` since it's not required. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
