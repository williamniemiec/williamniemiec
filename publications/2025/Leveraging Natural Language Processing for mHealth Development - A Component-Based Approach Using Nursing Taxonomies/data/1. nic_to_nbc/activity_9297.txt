Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Wheelchair Position Check": {
        "Parameters": {
            "Photo/Video Instructions": {},
            "Pad Selection": {},
            "Footwear Selection": {},
            "Position Check": {},
            "Frequency": {}
        }
    }
}


I removed `Deadline Date` as it's not applicable since it's a datetime type and doesn't have any specific options or values associated with it. Let me know if you need anything else!
