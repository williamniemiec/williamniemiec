Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Weight Variation Range": {
        "Weight Variation Range Title": {},
        "Target Weight Range": {"min": {}, "max": {}},
        "Acceptable Variation": {"min": {}, "max": {}},
        "Units": [{"value": "kg", "label": "Kilograms"}, {"value": "lb", "label": "Pounds"}, {"value": "oz", "label": "Ounces"}],
        "Rationale": {}
    }
}


Note that I removed the `Required` and `Type` fields as they are not part of the parameter specifications. Also, I didn't include the `Content Type` field as it's not a parameter specification. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
