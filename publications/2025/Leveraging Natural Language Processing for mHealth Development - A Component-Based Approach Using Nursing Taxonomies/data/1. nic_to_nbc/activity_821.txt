Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Balance Perception": {
    "Balance Perception": {
      "Description": "Please rate your balance on a scale from 1-5, where 1 is very poor and 5 is excellent",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "scale",
      "Options": [
        { "value": 1, "label": "Very Poor" },
        { "value": 2, "label": "Poor" },
        { "value": 3, "label": "Fair" },
        { "value": 4, "label": "Good" },
        { "value": 5, "label": "Excellent" }
      ]
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the "Additional Comments" parameter since it was marked as not required. Let me know if you'd like me to include it anyway!
