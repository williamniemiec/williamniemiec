Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Immunization Recommendations": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Recommendation List": {"Type": "list of recommendation names"},
      "Recommendation Details": {"Type": "list of text or html for each recommendation"},
      "Source": {"Type": "text"},
      "Date": {"Type": "date"}
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Update` parameter as it's not applicable, and also removed the introduction and conclusion sections. Let me know if this meets your requirements!
