Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Decision Support Tool": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Decision Topic": {"type": "text"},
      "Decision Factors": {"type": "list of text"},
      "Options": {"type": "list of text"},
      "Pros and Cons": {"type": "list of text"},
      "Resources": {"type": "list of URLs or text"}
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Decision Tracker` parameter since it's a boolean type, which is not applicable in this context. Let me know if you have any further questions!
