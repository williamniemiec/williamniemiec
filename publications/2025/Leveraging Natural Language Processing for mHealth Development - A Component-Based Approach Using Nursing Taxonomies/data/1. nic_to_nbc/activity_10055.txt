Here is the output in JSON format:


{

    "parameters": [
      {"Quick-acting Glucose": "A parameter that specifies the type and amount of quick-acting glucose to be taken."},
      {"Long-acting Carbohydrates": "A parameter that specifies the type and amount of long-acting carbohydrates to be taken."},
      {"Proteins": "A parameter that specifies the type and amount of proteins to be taken."},

    ]
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it is not applicable in this context.
