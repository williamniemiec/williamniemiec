Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Vital Sign Tracker": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Vital Sign Type": {},
      "Frequency": {},
      "Unit": {},
      "Target Range": {}
    }
  }
}


Note: I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter as it is not applicable in this context. Also, I assumed that the parameters without specific values should be represented as empty objects `{}` in the JSON output. If you need a different representation, please let me know!
