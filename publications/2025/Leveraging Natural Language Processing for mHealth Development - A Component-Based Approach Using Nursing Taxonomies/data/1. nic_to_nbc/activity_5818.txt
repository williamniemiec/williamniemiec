Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Technique Demonstration": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Technique Type": {"Type": "options"},
      "Demonstration Method": {"Type": "options"},
      "Demonstration Content": {"Type": "multimedia"},
      "Technique Tips": {"Type": ["text", "multimedia"]},
      "Practice Exercises": {"Type": "interactive"}
    }
  }
}


I removed all the text except for the `{{ NO-CODE ELEMENT NAME }}` and `{{ PARAMETER ESPECIFICATIONS }}`, and formatted it as a JSON object. I also removed any parameters that were marked as "Not Applicable". Let me know if this is what you were looking for!
