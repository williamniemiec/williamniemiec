Here is the output in JSON format:

    "Salt Amount": {
      "type": "number",
      "default": "1 teaspoon"
    },
    "Baking Soda Amount": {
      "type": "number",
      "default": "Â½ teaspoon"
    },
    "Water Amount": {
      "type": "number",
      "default": "1 pint"
    },
    "Water Temperature": {
      "type": "options",
      "options": ["lukewarm", "warm", "cool"]
    },
    "Salinity Adjustment": {
      "type": "options",
      "options": ["increase salinity", "decrease salinity", "no adjustment"]
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Notes` parameter because it was marked as optional, and I was instructed to remove not applicable parameters.
