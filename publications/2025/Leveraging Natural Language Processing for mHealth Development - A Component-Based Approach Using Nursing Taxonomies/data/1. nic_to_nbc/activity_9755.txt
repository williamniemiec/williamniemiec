Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Pregnancy Support": {
    "Support Options": {"Description": "list of support options available to the patient (e.g., counseling, support groups, etc.)", "Required": true, "Type": "list"},
    "Counseling": {"Description": "guidance on counseling for patients with unplanned or unwanted pregnancies", "Required": true, "Type": "html"}
  }
}


I removed the not applicable parameters (Resources and Questions) since they are not required. Let me know if this is what you were expecting!
