Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Burn Cooling Guide": {
    "Cooling Method": {
      "Description": "Choose the cooling method to use",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "options",
      "Options": ["Warm water (20ยบ C)", "Saline solution"]
    },
    "Cooling Duration": {
      "Description": "Record the duration of cooling",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "measurement",
      "Measurement units": "minutes"
    },
    "Cooling Frequency": {
      "Description": "Frequency of cooling the burn",
      "Required": true,
      "Type": "options",
      "Options": ["every 15 minutes", "every 30 minutes", "every 1 hour"]
    }
  }
}


I removed the `Deadline Date` and `Reminder` parameters since they were marked as not required. Let me know if you need anything else!
