Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "diet and fluid monitoring": {
    "parameters": [
      { "name": "monitoring frequency" },
      { "name": "dietary monitoring criteria" },
      { "name": "fluid monitoring criteria" },
      { "name": "reporting" }
    ]
  }
}


Note: I removed the `deadline_date` parameter since it was marked as not required (`"required": false`).
