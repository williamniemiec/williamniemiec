Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Immobilization Guide": {
    "parameters": {
      "Type of Injury": {},
      "Location of Injury": {},
      "Immobilization Method": {},
      "Instructions": {},
      "Frequency of Immobilization": {},
      "Duration of Immobilization": {},
      "Notes": {}
    }
  }
}


Note that I removed the `Deadline Date` parameter since it was specified as a datetime type, which is not applicable in this context. Let me know if you'd like me to keep it or make any further changes!
