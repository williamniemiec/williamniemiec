Here is the output in JSON format:


{
    "Pacing Support": {
        "name": {"type": "text"},
        "indications": {"type": "list of text items"},
        "duration": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "duration_type": {},
                "duration_value": {}
            }
        },
        "support_info": {"type": "text"}
    }
}


I removed the `image` parameter as it's marked as "not applicable" (it can be either an image URL or base64-encoded image, which is not a standard type). Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
