Here is the output in JSON format:


{
  "Meal Planner": {
    "Parameters": {
      "Meal Planning Steps": {"Type": "list of tutorial steps"},
      "Meal Ideas": {"Type": "list of meal ideas or recipes with ingredients and instructions"},
      "Dietary Restrictions": {"Type": "options or text"},
      "Meal Planning Template": {"Type": "interactive table or form"},
      "Tips and Reminders": {"Type": "list of text or interactive elements"}
    }
  }
}


I removed all unnecessary information, including the introduction, conclusion, and other elements that are not parameters. I also reformatted the output to be in JSON format, with the no-code element name as a key, and its parameters as values. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
