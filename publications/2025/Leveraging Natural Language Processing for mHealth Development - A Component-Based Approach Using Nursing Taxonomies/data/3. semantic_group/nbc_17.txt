  "description": "The 'Breathing Control' element monitors and manages respiratory health and breathing techniques. It tracks ventilation settings, breathing patterns, lung sounds, and provides guidance on proper breathing, inhalation exercises, and cough management. This element aims to optimize pulmonary health, guide users through breathing exercises, and provide respiratory assessments based on monitored data.",
